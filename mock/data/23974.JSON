I’ve tackled it in several ways, but the policy idea below is one of the more intriguing of options, in my opinion. It stems from research done by academics from the University of Albany, George Washington University, and Clean Power Research; an article from the Institute for Local Self-Reliance ; and a policy put in place by Austin Energy . First of all, the issue that gets to me is that the value of solar power is consistently underestimated in our e","m_szDocBody":"zachary shahan solar policy ive tackled way policy idea intriguing
