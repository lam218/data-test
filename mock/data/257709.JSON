April 9th, 2014 by John Farrell   In March 2014, Minnesota became the first state to adopt a “ value of solar ” policy to set a fair, transparent price on solar energy. It may serve as a national precedent and fundamentally change the financial relationship between electric utilities and their energy-producing customers. So what will value of solar mean for utility customers producing power with solar? The Value Of Solar Concept The basic concept behind value of solar is that utilities should pay a transparent and market-based price for solar energy.
