I think that there are more pitfalls than many realize. Pitfall 1. Green solutions tend to push us from one set of resources that are a problem today (fossil fuels) to other resources that are likely to be problems in the longer term. The name of the game is “kicking the can down the road a little.” In a finite world, we are ","m_szDocBody":"oil major seek drive solar innovation qatar cold hard truth renewable recent climate accord

oil encountering young people unable goodpaying job oil price decline rise create problem renewable green alternative needed subsidy rise disappear falling oil price oil price quickly low producer
