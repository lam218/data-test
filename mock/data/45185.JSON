Or just the body? Benjamin Nead Would I want to 3D print an electric motor? Probably not. If there are small parts involved that might be difficult to machine out of a metal like titanium (see the link in one of my above posts regarding the 3D printed bicycle,) then yes for those. But electric motor housings are probably going to be cast and/or machined aluminum for now and, interestingly, aluminum is a metal that does lend itself particularly well to 3D printing technology.
