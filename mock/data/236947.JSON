Just like this article, it was titled ‚Äú EV Disruption .‚Äù Interestingly, it comes from someone living in Texas, home of the US oil industry. The post echoes a lot of the key points I‚Äôve made over the past few years‚Ä¶ and I thus like it very much. üòÄ He also makes some points I don‚Äôt think I fully agree with, but I get the argument, and think he could be right. Anyhow, have a read and then chime in with your own thoughts and/","m_szDocBody":"disruption zachary shahan ran great post month ago tesla motor club forum finally sharing article titled disruption
