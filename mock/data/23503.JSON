Unfortunately for utilities, new technology and commercial opportunities in the coming years are only increasing the threat to the 1.0 business model. Solar energy is growing exponentially as costs have fallen 28% per year from 2009-2013, and electricity from rooftops is approaching or passing parity with utility prices.63 This is the third of four parts of ILSR’s Beyond Utility 2.0 to Energy Democracy report being published in serial.
