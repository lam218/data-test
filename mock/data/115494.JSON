Well, it turns out that even defective graphene may be valuable. According to a team of mostly-American scientists, improperly-formed graphene could find use in next-generation fuel cells. Among other things, those cells might allow electric cars to be recharged in the amount of time that it currently takes to refuel a gas-burning vehicl","m_szDocBody":"imperfect graphene perfect fuel cell throw graphene hole protonfriendly image university minnesota knew graphene highly material well turn defective graphene valuable team mostlyamerican scientist improperlyformed graphene nextgeneration fuel cell thing cell electric car recharged amount time take refuel gasburning vehicle graphene people know oneatomthick layer carbon atom linked honeycomb pattern sometime however uniform structure marred gap form adjacent atom back gap moment proton exchange membrane fuel cell meanwhile work separating proton hydrogen polymer electrolyte membrane proton pass through membrane hundred nanometer thick however take minute tiny proton make through graphene thinner regular form impermeable proton room temperature scientist discovered however gap imperfect graphene size proton water pass proton second handful hole square micron graphene found sufficient process work effectively our result make fuel cell tomorrow mechanism engineer design proton separation membrane complicated people thought before lead scientist franz geiger northwestern university all slightly imperfect singlelayer graphene taking part study scientist university minnesota pennsylvania state university oak ridge national laboratory university virginia university puerto rico paper research published week nature communication source university minnesota experienced freelance writer videographer television producer ben interest form innovation fanatical humanpowered transportation filmmaking gear environmentallyfriendly technology designed underwater live edmonton alberta spend lot time handlebar mountain bike hanging offleash park wishing pacific ocean away ","m_szGeo1":"Australia","m_szSourceType":"source_news","m_szSrcUrl":"http://www.gizmag.com/imperfect-graphene-fuel-cells/36638/","m_Places":["Well","Edmonton, Alberta","Pacific Ocean"],"m_People":["Franz M.
