Lithium-sulfur batteries are a promising alternative to today’s lithium-ion batteries. “There is currently a great need for high-energy, long-life, and low-cost energy storage materials, and lithium sulfur batteries are one of the most promising candidates,” says Weidong Zhou, a former postdoctora","m_szDocBody":"food build lithium battery food build lithium battery futurity posted wed component corn starch yolkshell structure egg improve durability performance lithiumsulfur battery cathode report researcher lithiumsulfur battery promising alternative today lithiumion battery great highenergy longlife lowcost energy storage material lithium sulphur battery promising candidate weidong zhou postdoctoral researcher professor hector abruas lab cornell university paper published acs nano american chemical electric vehicle solar wind power application lithiumbased battery technology countless unstable battery lithiumsulfur battery potentially offer time energy density today typically lithiumion battery yingchao phd student abrua cofirst jac publication lithiumsulfur battery stable system capacity fade short period time related article japan recycling vehicle battery renewable power charge cycle energy density lithiumsulfur battery decrease rapidly due phenomenon called polysulfide shuttling effect polysulfide chain battery cathode positive end dissolve electrolyte ionising liquid electron flow combat problem stabilise sulphur researcher amylopectin polysaccharide main component corn starch corn starch effectively wrap graphene oxidesulfide composite hydrogen bonding confine polysulfide carbon layer hao chen cofirst acs nano phd student lab francis disalvo paper coauthor professor chemistry chemical biology additive greatly improve cycling stability battery egg design approach improving lithiumsulfur battery durability researcher report make lithiumsulfur cathode synthesising nanocomposite consisting sulphur coated common inexpensive conductive polymer called polyaniline modelled egg encased shell room move inside similar sulfurpolyaniline composite previously synthesised coreshell structure method internal void polymer shell called yolkshell structure lithiumsulfur battery fully discharged volume sulphur expanded dramatically percent beauty egg yolk empty space inside space yolk expand say related article love tesla dislike tsla polyaniline coating chemically benzene ring ammonium strung crosslinked chain soft flexible protect shell cracking long cycling provisional patent innovation filed cornell centre technology commercialization enterprise cornell startup company called lionano inc commercialising technology marketplace department energy energy material centre cornell energy frontier research centre funded doe funded paper researcher electron microscopy facility cornell centre material research support national science foundation material research science engineering centre programme anne jucornell ","m_szGeo1":"United Kingdom","m_szSourceType":"source_industry","m_szSrcUrl":"http://oilprice.com/Energy/Energy-General/How-Food-Can-Build-Better-Lithium-Batteries.html","m_Places":["Japan"],"m_People":["Weidong Zhou","Hector Abruna","Nano","Yingchao Yu","Francis Disalvo","Yu","Love Tesla","Anne Ju"],"m_Companies":["Cornell University","Acs","Journal Of The American Chemical Society","Abruña And Co","Cornell Center","Lionano Inc.","Department Of Energy","Research Center","National Science Foundation"],"m_BiGrams":["lithiumsulfur battery","corn starch"],"m_TriGrams":[],"m_SocialTags":[],"m_Topics":[],"m_Industry":[],"m_Technology":[],"m_BiCnt":[7,3],"m_TriCnt":[],"m_iDocBodyWordCnt":317}
