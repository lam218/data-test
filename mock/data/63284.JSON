The report, World Nuclear Report 2013 , is well worth a more careful look, but for those who just love some interesting charts, here are the two that our ever-alert reader shared as well as a few more I pulled out: Data Sources: AGEB 2013 Data Source: IAEA-PRIS, BP, 2013 Data Source: BNEF 2013 and WNISR original research, 2013 Data Sources: IAEA-PRIS, MSC, 2013 Note: ","m_szDocBody":"interesting
