But we can do it. The first step is to start with the easy stuff. Credit: NASA/Flickr. If our transition to renewable energy is successful, we will achieve savings in the ongoing energy expenditures needed for economic production. We will be rewarded with a quality of life that is acceptable â€” and, perhaps, preferable to our current one (even though, for most Americans, material consumption will be scaled
