Even climate deniers have some idea of how it works, though they may pretend it’s not happening. The technical details of anthropogenic global warming are as follows: Humans produce atmospheric carbon through burning things and making cement. This atmospheric carbon blocks the escape of black-body radiation coming from the earth which would otherwise cool it. Surface temperatures on earth increase. There’s obviously a lot more to it than that, but this is the basi","m_szDocBody":"reverse global warming heat cris pond people anthropogenic global warming climate denier idea work pretend happening
