A team of researchers has come up with a solution based on the structure of a pomegranate, which could combine greater efficiency with commercial-scale durability. The solution addresses one weak link, the anode (the anode is the negative electrode, which stores energy as you charge up the battery), so let’s dig in and see what this new pomegranate batter","m_szDocBody":"tina casey lithiumion battery gold standard powering electric vehicle fuel cell breathing neck pressure nextgeneration performance improvement team researcher solution based structure pomegranate combine greater efficiency commercialscale durability solution addresse weak link anode the anode negative electrode store energy charge battery let dig pomegranate battery about pomegranate battery greg carbon solution silicon problem conventional liion battery anode based graphite good term durability term efficiency that researcher making eye silicon potential store time charge graphite however problem silicon brittle battery charge silicon swell battery discharge shrink activity silicon flake apart react electrolyte form gunk stick anode interfering efficiency couple promising avenue research emerged solving problem reinforcement carbon nanotube scaffolding devised team university north carolina similar approach researcher lawrence berkeley national laboratory involve sandwiching nanolayer silicon form carbon favourite nanomaterial millennium graphene pomegranate battery solution pomegranate solution based carbon take tack developed team based stanford institute material energy science partnership department energy slac national accelerator laboratory project researcher previously devised method encasing nanoparticle silicon carbon shell particle small broken smaller piece swell shrink carbon shell room accommodate change size current stage development draw microemulsion process common number conventional industry including cosmetic paint manufacturing idea make cluster shellencased silicon nanoparticle coat layer carbon pomegranate single large sphere fraction total surface area shellencased nanoparticle smaller surface area mean exposure electrolyte reduce gunk factor shellencased silicon nanoparticle nian liu zhenda dont hold breath pomegranate battery wait what cover research project include dontholdyourbreath reminder long very long trail lab commercial development however pomegranate battery research year lab stanford researcher cui founder liion battery company called amprius amprius ring bell month company raised million funding commercialise firstgeneration version silicon based liion battery goody store future company introduce nextgeneration version record company made new month energy secretary steven chu joined board director month follow google latest new cleantechnica electric vehicle newsletter cleantechnicas completely free electric car report electric car early adopter follower want youd attend electric vehicle solar power event conducted cleantechnica date hottest cleantech new subscribing free cleantech newsletter eye sectorspecific new also free solar energy newsletter electric vehicle newsletter wind energy newsletter ","m_szGeo1":"United States","m_szSourceType":"source_industry","m_szSrcUrl":"http://cleantechnica.com/2014/02/17/new-pomegranate-li-ion-battery-improvement/","m_Places":[],"m_People":["Tina Casey","Greg Stewart","Nian Liu","Zhenda Lu","Yi CuI","Steven Chu"],"m_Companies":["University Of North Carolina","Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory","Stanford Institute","Department Of Energy","Slac National Accelerator Laboratory","Twitter","Google"],"m_BiGrams":["pomegranate battery","electric vehicle","liion battery"],"m_TriGrams":[],"m_SocialTags":[],"m_Topics":[],"m_Industry":[],"m_Technology":[],"m_BiCnt":[5,4,3],"m_TriCnt":[],"m_iDocBodyWordCnt":346}
