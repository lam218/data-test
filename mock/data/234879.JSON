This plus range, and we could calculate MPGe. I bet it would beat most gas GROUND CARS! Ronald Brakels Well, a light plane might cruise at about 60% of maximum engine capacity, so that would suggest about a 30 kilowatt-hours of charge in the batteries since it can fly for an hour, giving about 5 kilometers per kilowatt-hour. anderlan So, nearly a gallon’s worth of energy for an hour of flying.  That is awesome.  A little more than however Miles you can get…PGe.  So, 90MPGe, maybe.
