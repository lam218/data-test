The technology replaces the traditional glass sunroof with solar technology that generates electricity to recharge a car’s batteries while either cooling or warming the parked car depending on the weather. Of course, a solar-powered sun roof does not provide nearly enough energy to power an entire car. It might be enough to keep some ventilation fans blowing, b","m_szDocBody":"solar sunroof recharge car battery temperature control ariel schwartz sunroof longer easy route windblown hair sunburn
