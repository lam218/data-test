A modern technological solution to everything that makes comfortable middle class people uneasy? Well then, you’ll probably be interested in hearing about the latest 3D-printed marketing gimmick — taking a design and principle that’s been in use for millennia (evaporative cooling) and saddling it with the complexity and associated investment + manufacturing costs of 3D printing.
