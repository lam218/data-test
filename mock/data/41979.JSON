In part 1 of this article, we looked at how batteries are considered the primary format for energy storage . But that's not to say that other technologies are not being developed. Moving beyond batteries Moving power storage/distribution away from battery technology, Dr Timothy Maxwell and John Fleming are in the middle of a very unique project at Texas Tech University (TTU) . It addresses not only affordable electricity storage, but affordable fuel and even fertilisers.","m_szDocBody":"option energy storage joyce laird part energy storage involve battery continue joyce
