Tyres can’t be generators. Not at any reasonable cost / performance. paulblair The laws of physics dictate that this can’t work. NRG4All What would be the possible amount of electricity generated?  Or even efficiency? Philip W I was wondering the same thing. JamesWimberley There must be thermodynamic issues with this. The ev’s battery makes the wheels go round. Turning the wheels into generators isn’t a free lunch; the energy goes back to the battery, and there must – must – be losses in the round trip.
