By Karl-Friedrich Lenz No, I am not talking about the default. Greece has failed to meet a payment to the IMF today. This post is about the complete shutdown of new solar energy in Greece. A couple of numbers show the extent of that collapse ( from PV Magazine ): In 2012, Greece added 890 MW. In 2013, 1047 MW. And then the numbers completely collapsed to only 13 MW in 2014. This year has seen 7 MW from January to April, with zero in March and April. So the 2014 record is only about one percent of the 2013 record.
