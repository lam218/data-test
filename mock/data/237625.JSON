Poor people live very differently in other countries because they’re so numerous that infrastructure still has to be built around their needs, not the needs of a McMansion voter who can decree cuts in social programs and mass transit so that a trillion dollars can be spent on military needs and obligations. 80 years ago our poor could use trains and streetcars to get to the good jobs.
