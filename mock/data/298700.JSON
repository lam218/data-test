mitigating environmental public safety threat approximately onethird size nuclear power plant operating ussmall modular reactor advantageous diversifying safety environmental risk larger nuclear power plant active safety feature require human interaction function properly small modular nuclear reactor designed employ passive safety feature engineered work physical law inherent safety feature require fewer moveable part operate safely small modular nuclear reactor manufactured factory transported site reduce constraint capital construction time smaller size improve adaptability utility scale electric grid situation demand large reactor academic support governmental energy policy initiative energy policy institute university chicago published report concluding small modular reactor critical future nuclear power generation united state report evaluated economic feasibility traditional large scale nuclear power reactor compared smaller modular nuclear reactor generating capacity megawatt less separate report cost estimated kilowatt build large scale reactor approximately kilowatt higher earlier estimate material change primarily commodity price increase represent significant project cost inflation year opportunity nuclear industry adapt change large impediment nuclear power industry united state extensive time cost build nuclear plant expected delay revenue generation
