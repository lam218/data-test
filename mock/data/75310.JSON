Back in July, in my quest to see whether British Columbia could become a 100% renewable energy region, I looked at personal transportation. This week I take on the far more challenging task of long-distance trucking, boats, ferries and planes. Ponder this: a typical eighteen-wheeler truck has a 400-horse-power engine. It burns stored solar energy from ancient, 300-million-year-old marine organisms. If you used horses to pull that much load, youâ€™d need 400 of them, and 400 hectares","m_szDocBody":"renewable energy region trucking ship plane read part part sery back july quest british columbia
