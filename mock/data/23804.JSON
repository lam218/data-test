As you’ll see, it’s in response to some absurd forecasts regarding US renewable energy adoption. Here’s one highlight: it was forecast that we would reach 0.45 GW of Solar PV on the grid by 2035, in November 2013 we reached 7.11 GW according to the FERC. Surely, in making new predictions it would be appropriate for the EIA to addre","m_szDocBody":"deceiving eia forecast letter cleantechnica reader zachary shahan open letter cleantechnica reader wrote

cheapest considerable margin eia figure plant eias forecast shitastic dont cite forecast expect agree you bobwallace realise eia price prediction flawed capacity prediction eia predict onshore wind cost cent nrel also part doe report average price onshore wind sale ppas cent kwh price lowered cent subsidy call cent cost prediction price continuing fall peter moss missed point eia figure prediction not figure cost plant coming line today dollar mean plant built currently make assumption price current onshore wind sale represent cost production failed fact wind farm tax shelter making allowance investment tax credit subsidy also price quote fob include transmission line cost eia doe reason cost wind production continue fall appear mature technology development future anticipate reduce price hardware significantly actually price depressed due chinese dumping solar market has real libertarian missed point eia figure prediction not figure cost plant coming line today dollar mean plant built currently take year wind farm built solar quicker bobwallace peter overnight cost plant stated cent electricity produced priced ptc wind solar cent kwh year production adjust cent selling price wind upward cent cent realise wind farm owner profit included cent considerably cent peter moss issue low price price subsidy equal actual lcoe electricity produced eia price include
