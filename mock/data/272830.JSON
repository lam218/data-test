One of the world’s biggest solar manufacturers and project developers, the US-based First Solar, has predicted that utility-scale solar costs in Australia will halve over the next five years, becoming cheaper than wind energy by 2020. First Solar says this should mean that large-scale solar takes up an increasing amount of the capacity required to be built under the current 41,000GWh target. However, First Solar’s prediction about costs are predicated on the renewable energy target not being removed or diluted","m_szDocBody":"solar cheaper wind year originally published reneweconomy world
