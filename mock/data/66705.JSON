New 'Miracle Material' Is Flexible While Also As Hard As A Diamond Jun. 10, 2013,  7:39 AM 21,550 en.wikipedia.org The race is on to harness the potential of graphene, a substance that is harder than diamond, yet incredibly flexible, and the worldâ€™s best conductor of electricity. Kostya Novoselov tends to wear an air of slight distraction. But when a problem or topic of conversation sparks his curiosity, his gentle, rather doughy features settle and his focus visibly intensifies. To watch this happen is to watch a great mind at work.
