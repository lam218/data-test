Tucson Electric Power acquires just 4% of its electricity from renewable resources (and over 70% from coal), despite being at the heart of the best sunshine in the country. The red arrow shows Tucson on this map of the nation’s solar resource: Despite a world-class solar resource, the Tucson utility intends to install far more power ","m_szDocBody":"utility make solar
