He sums up the immensity of the danger and then leads into the need for electric cars that do not use fossil fuels. You can also watch AFP’s video on this segment of the talk  on YouTube. Regardless of all else regarding the climate (which is plenty!), fracking is NOT safe — it spurs earthquakes , creates horrible waste that can show up in the drinking water (and even make it flammable
