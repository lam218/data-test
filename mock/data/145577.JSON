They expect high prices and more demand than supply. Other people talk about energy demand hitting a peak many years from now, perhaps when most of us have electric cars. Neither of these views is correct. The real situation is that we right now seem to be reaching peak energy demand through low commodity prices. I see evidence of this in the historical energy data","m_szDocBody":"data suggest reaching peak energy demand wednesday comment gail tverberg follow follow people talk peak energy oil supply expect
