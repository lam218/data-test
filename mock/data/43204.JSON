A spinoff of the similarly named company Graphene Laboratories, Inc., Graphene 3D Lab was formed to develop new high tech graphene based materials for 3D printing. So, who cares who is married to whom? Being as how graphene is the nanomaterial of the new millenium , and 3D printing is the best thing to ever happen next to sliced bread, all we care about is whether or not the 3D-printed graphene battery","m_szDocBody":"dprinted battery pack graphene punch tina casey forbe married couple force dprinted graphene battery graphene lab spinoff similarly named company graphene laboratory inc graphene lab formed develop tech graphene based material printing care married whom graphene nanomaterial millenium printing happen sliced bread care dprinted graphene battery prototype pan out grapheneenabled dprintable device screenshot courtesy graphene lab what dprinted graphene battery graphene technology battery composed nanoplatelet graphene added polymer fancyspeak spiking plastic dprinted thingamajig tiny shot graphene frequently discussed cleantechnica sister site planetsave gasorg graphene form carbon possesse unique electronic property superhero strength make ideal battery supercapacitor photovoltaic cell number clean tech application recently adding graphene mystique example appearance ingredient teslas rumoured mile battery here graphene describe soupedup printing sauce form nanoplatelet graphene affect material extraordinary way addition graphene material share phenomenal property graphene itself mechanically strong thermal electrical conductivity greatly improved courtesy graphene lab screenshot step dprinted graphene battery prototype introduced week aptly named inside printing conference santa clara california judging press material graphene lab cool battery integrated dprinted object object built graphene degree precise customization battery enhanced performance potential compared nonintegrated battery technique applied supercapacitor electrochemical device btw meanwhile mind battery prototype phase step month graphene announced partnership stony brook university long island round quality control testing oneyear agreement call graphene pay research foundation suny the state university york include stony brook campus exchange analytical service stony brook number connexion advanced graphene research before campus called stony brook centre advanced sensor technology lab part york state cat programme consist network centre advanced technology cat aimed attracted alist research talent state encourage collaboration suny campuse york industry sensor cat stony brook lab affectionately known run graphene graphene filament pace examining functional mechanical capability speaking collaboration laboratory sensor cat managed cofounder graphene professor mikhail gouzman agreement graphene engage stony brook student analytic process aim readying career graphene tech venture cheque back graphene sensor cat update available stay tuned follow google youd attend cleantechnica solar event date hottest cleantech new subscribing free cleantech newsletter eye sectorspecific new also free solar energy newsletter electric vehicle newsletter wind energy newsletter ","m_szGeo1":"United States","m_szSourceType":"source_news","m_szSrcUrl":"http://cleantechnica.com/2014/10/25/new-3d-printed-battery-packs-graphene-punch/?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+IM-cleantechnica+%28CleanTechnica%29","m_Places":["Tesla","Santa Clara, California","Long Island, Ny","New York","New York State"],"m_People":["Graphene Punch","Tina Casey","Forbes","Suny","Mikhail Gouzman"],"m_Companies":["Stony Brook University","Stony Brook","Advanced Technology","Twitter","Google"],"m_BiGrams":["stony brook","graphene lab","dprinted graphene","graphene battery","battery prototype","sensor cat"],"m_TriGrams":["dprinted graphene battery"],"m_SocialTags":[],"m_Topics":[],"m_Industry":[],"m_Technology":[],"m_BiCnt":[],"m_TriCnt":[],"m_iDocBodyWordCnt":346}
