The plane, the Solar Impulse , was designed by Bertrand Piccard, who was the first person to travel around the world nonstop in a balloon back in 1999. The main innovation of the Solar Impulse is its capacity to fly overnight, thanks to its energy-efficient battery system and its light spartan build. For a plane, it’s very light, weighing less than an SUV. It’s powered by 12,000 solar cells cove","m_szDocBody":"solar powered plane circumnavigate globe can fly night jame ayre nonstop solarpowered flight world planned plane solar impulse designed bertrand piccard person travel world nonstop balloon back main innovation solar impulse capacity fly overnight energyefficient battery system light spartan build plane light weighing suv powered solar cell covering long wing build battery technology fly nonstop dark night sky potentially staying airborne indefinitely storing power day night cell capture energy sun transform electricity piccard explain electricity simultaneously engine battery reach sunrise capture sun again continue theoretically forever piccard psychologist aeronaut thought idea year ago circumnavigated globe nonstop balloon trip required enormous amount fuel resource motivated design efficient selfsufficient similar again research design piccard business partner andr borschberg unveiled solar impulse solarpowered plane independent fuel sun year plane unveiled demonstrated effectiveness performing overnight flight switzerland lasting hour minute year plane made record international flight spain morocco videos posted solar impulse website capture odd craft slowly taking floating air monitor write ideal flying speed mile hour lack brute energetic force make quiet grace flying doesnt capture plane motion appear suspended midair solar impulse close marketready though course market this million investment year main issue remaining that extremely light storm dangerous highly efficient energy cockpit climate control plane remain prone stalling low speed borschberg piccard hope complete purely solarpowered flight spring entrepreneur plan impulse day trip globe image credit solarimpulsecom cleantechnicas completely free electric car report electric car early adopter follower want youd attend electric vehicle solar power event conducted cleantechnica date hottest cleantech new subscribing free cleantech newsletter eye sectorspecific new also free solar energy newsletter electric vehicle newsletter wind energy newsletter tag battery pack solar transportation fly world solar plane solar impulse solar power air flight circumnavigation solar power plane solar powered plane night flight solarpowered plane jame ayre background predominantly geopolitic history obsessive interest pretty everything early life spent imperial free city dortmund jame river ruhr cofbuokheim attended university astnide briefly considered entering coal mining business write living broad variety subject ranging science politic military history renewable energy follow work google related post ","m_szGeo1":"United States","m_szSourceType":"source_industry","m_szSrcUrl":"http://cleantechnica.com/2012/12/06/solar-powered-plane-will-circumnavigate-the-globe-in-2015-can-even-fly-at-night/","m_Places":["Switzerland","Spain","Morocco","Us","Free City","Dortmund"],"m_People":["James Ayre","Bertrand Piccard","Andre Borschberg"],"m_Companies":["Grace","University Of Astnide","Google"],"m_BiGrams":["solar impulse","plane solar","solar power"],"m_TriGrams":[],"m_SocialTags":[],"m_Topics":[],"m_Industry":[],"m_Technology":[],"m_BiCnt":[6,3,3],"m_TriCnt":[],"m_iDocBodyWordCnt":342}
