Are Hydrogen Fuel Cell Vehicles Dead On Arrival? By Barry Stevens Posted on Wed, 16 April 2014 21:31 | 6 The national vision by politicians, economists, industrialists and environmentalists to transition to hydrogen economy by 2030 seems deadlocked, with hydrogen fuel cells projected to represent a $3 billion market of about 5.9 GW by 2030, according to Lux Research , Figure 1.(1) The dream of fuel cell vehicles powered by hydrogen from
