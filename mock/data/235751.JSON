No. Did you actually read that Inside EV article? The author speculated that Mitsubishi is distancing itself from the I-MiEV (and I don’t doubt the company will continue to promote it poorly) But at least this article directly quoted the original Masuko interview, where it’s clearly stated that no replacement of the I-MiEV is being planned. “No replacement planned” is NOT the same as “pulled the plug!” eveee Got it. I played with the words. No replacement is planned. Thats a shame.
