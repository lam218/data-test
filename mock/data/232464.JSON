It has been reposted with full permission. There was a huge response to our article on Wednesday, summarising the UBS report on how a boom in un-subsidised solar installations  would cause a revolution in energy markets. Most people wanted more details of how UBS arrived at their calculations, so we’ve decided to share more of their report on what makes solar PV – and battery storage – such a compelling proposition to
