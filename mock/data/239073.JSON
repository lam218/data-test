Oil is destined to be a heated issue in this upcoming presidential election and Barack Obama’s opposition to the gas tax “holiday” has already been a hot topic.

bargain,” said Obama.  “","m_szDocBody":"obamas plan reduce foreign oil dependence sarah lozanova american spend million foreign oil hour left broke pump plan obama solve problem oil destined heated
