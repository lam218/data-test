Originally published on ZacharyShahan.com Note: the hypothetical question as asked on Quora was a bit more… hypothetical. It was: If all cars in the US suddenly become electric, how much more electricity do we need to produce (in percentage)? Here was  my response : It’s an interesting question, but also a question that seems much simpler than it actually is. As Ryan has done, you can use some static assumptions, plug in some numbers, and come up with a guess… but that approach is going to end up way off in realit","m_szDocBody":"car electric electricity
