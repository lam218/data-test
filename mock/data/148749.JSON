IEA Energy Technology Essentials The IEA Energy Technology Essentials are regularly-updated briefs that draw together the best-available, consolidated information on energy technologies from the IEA network ETE 05 Hydrogen Production & Distribution  PRODUCTION & COSTS– Hydrogen (H2) is an energy carrier. It can be produced from all forms of energy and used for power generation or as a transport fuel, mainly in association with fuel cells. Natural gas and coal are currently the cheapest sources o","m_szDocBody":"send comment iea energy technology essential iea energy technology essential regularlyupdated brief draw bestavailable
