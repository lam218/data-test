Usage of these resins will be segmented into a wide variety of applications and analyses, and will include some intracompetition of these resins among themselves along with selected commodity thermoplastics and thermosets. REASONS FOR DOING THE STUDY Traditional engineering resins and polymer alloys/blends have been \"around\" for decades and, yet, there are few studies that analyze in detail all of the major materials
