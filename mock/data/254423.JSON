They’re being pushed, clearly. timerbeltkiller Of the 100 million private cars manufactured in 2020 I guess just one million will be EVs. Remember EVs are only saleable in more than micro quantities in countries subsidizing them.  Today that is mainly the US, Norway and Japan. Tesla grabbing 500 K and BMW 100 K seems realistic. Nissan/Renault group is lite yrs off target. Jouni Valkonen Elon Musk predicts that in 2025 there is sold 50 million fully electric vehicles.
