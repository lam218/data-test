Of course, the Lux analysis was pretty thoroughly derided here, at least.  Still, it makes me wonder a bit just when that conference call happened. S.Nkm If there’s overproduction the price will fall even further…. which will lead to more sales and more demand? Kevin McKinney Yes, that’s a factor I thought of, too.  Did Lux?  They apparently didn’t discuss it. Mike Shurtleff “Lux analysis was pretty thoroughly derided here” Yes, I believe three good points were made: 1.
