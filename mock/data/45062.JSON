Two eco-friendly cars, one of which is the first in Singapore to be made using 3D-printed parts, were unveiled yesterday by Nanyang Technological University. The 3D-printed prototype, called the NTU Venture 8, has a cabin made of printed components glued together using epoxy adhesive. A total of 150 panels were used in its construction - the largest assembly of 3D-printed parts to be put together here. Each of the 3D-printed components is made from acrylonitrile butadiene styrene, a lightweight plastic.
