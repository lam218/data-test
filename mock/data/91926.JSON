Methanol is used for a number of different purposes, primarily though, as a fuel, in the production of many important adhesives and solvents, and in the production of plastics. It’s been suggested by researchers in some fields that methanol could be used as a replacement for gasoline (at least partially) — despite its corrosivity — with only minimal adjust","m_szDocBody":"jame ayre lowcost mean converting carbon dioxide methanol developed researcher stanford university slac national accelerator laboratory technical university denmark methanol number purpose primarily though fuel production important adhesive solvent production plastic suggested researcher field methanol replacement gasoline partially corrosivity minimal adjustment vehicle design lowcost conversion method discovery nickelgallium catalyst convert hydrogen carbon dioxide methanol fewer sideproduct conventional catalyst methanol processed huge factory pressure hydrogen carbon dioxide carbon monoxide natural gas stated study lead felix studt staff scientist slac material make methanol clean source lowpressure condition generating low amount carbon monoxide ultimately studt goal process scaled industrial level remaining nonpolluting carbon neutral imagine synthesise methanol hydrogen renewable source water split sunlight carbon dioxide captured power plant industrial smokestack explained coauthor jen nrskov professor chemical engineering stanford eventually make higher alcohol ethanol propanol which unlike methanol directly added gasoline today stanford university more worldwide million metric tonne methanol produced year manufacture paint polymer glue product typical methanol plant natural gas water converted synthesis gas syngas consist carbon monoxide carbon dioxide hydrogen syngas converted methanol highpressure process catalyst made copper zinc aluminium studt colleague understood methanol synthesis molecular level began hunt catalyst capable synthesising methanol low pressure hydrogen carbon dioxide testing variety compound lab studt searched promising catalyst massive computerised database coauthor frank abildpedersen developed slac comparing copperzincaluminum catalyst thousand material database promising candidate turned littleknown compound called nickelgallium compound computer test nrskov stared dont lab experiment here good experimental partner research technical university denmark synthesising testing nickelgallium catalyst test confirmed predicted temperature nickelgallium produced methanol conventional copperzincaluminum catalyst considerably carbon monoxide byproduct make methanol carbon monoxide chorkendorff said catalyst stable doesnt decompose lab test showed nickelgallium fact stable solid researcher working finetune catalyst finding published nature chemistry cleantechnicas completely free electric car report electric car early adopter follower date hottest cleantech new subscribing free cleantech newsletter eye sectorspecific new also free solar energy newsletter electric vehicle newsletter wind energy newsletter tag methanol nickelgallium catalyst slac national accelerator laboratory stanford university technical university denmark jame ayre background predominantly geopolitic history obsessive interest pretty everything early life spent imperial free city dortmund jame river ruhr cofbuokheim attended university astnide briefly considered entering coal mining business write living broad variety subject ranging science politic military history renewable energy follow work google related post ","m_szGeo1":"Denmark","m_szSourceType":"source_news","m_szSrcUrl":"http://cleantechnica.com/2014/03/04/low-cost-methanol-carbon-dioxide-relatively-cheap-conversion-method-developed/","m_Places":["Free City","Dortmund"],"m_People":["James Ayre","Felix Studt","Jens Nørskov"],"m_Companies":["Stanford University","Slac National Accelerator Laboratory","Technical University Of Denmark","University Of Astnide","Google"],"m_BiGrams":["carbon dioxide","carbon monoxide","stanford university","technical university","university denmark","nickelgallium catalyst","hydrogen carbon"],"m_TriGrams":["hydrogen carbon dioxide"],"m_SocialTags":[],"m_Topics":[],"m_Industry":[],"m_Technology":[],"m_BiCnt":[6,5,3,3,3,3,3],"m_TriCnt":[3],"m_iDocBodyWordCnt":378}
