Canada also has effective energy corridors and a highly trained work force which can develop and implement the next generation of clean energy technologies required to drive an economic and environmentally-sustainable energy sector. All of Canadaâ€™s energy resources should be considered together to form an integrated energy system which maximizes the benefits and wealth for the country and adaptively takes advantage of future opportunities.
