Credit: Peter Larsson Battery weight has long vexed engineers designing electric cars for the mass market. Bigger batteries are needed to power a car for longer distances, but their weight in turn requires the car to expend more energy. But what if the body of the car itself was a battery? Researchers at Sweden's KTH Royal Institute of Technology have found a promising solution with carbon fibre.
