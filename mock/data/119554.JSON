area time working area smaller smaller chance failure larger larger linear badly manufactured battery beginning eliminated exponentially worse point time put number spreadsheet playing damage geometrically worse ken link total desperate fail prove exponential drop claimed talk gradual decline proved completely wrong again battery haver teslas battery maintained constant temperature small fraction cycled minimising gradual effect mentioned proven completely wrong again wont admit destroying credibility thinking person more bobwallace cell failure battery pack age nissan recently reported battery pack designed deal sort low level failure individual car showed higher rate failure there reason expect evenly distributed pack opened bad cell replaced posted curve battery capacity drop time chart wasnt linked curve apply cell tesla probably chemistry cell holding nicely past cycle cycle mile range mean mile car trash battery life tesla battery nonissue ivor oconnor expect tesla balanced balancing longevity versus performance else word worry battery life tesla battery problem graph attempted right totally subject basically crystalline build nature point linear eponential failure point brookhaven national laboratory link line linear exponential determined chemistry mix ivor oconnor hoping tesla body interior forever maintenance rubberized item easily swapped unlike traditional ice vehicle crap bobwallace tesla stated owner problem battery average driving year ken wow great new bob thank ken bob post above nicely reasoned ben dishonest fool people follow simple science bobwallace let assume battery price kwh not production cost end price let start faulty assumption make easier reach conclusion reach but equivalent full cycle cycle mile range mile battery fall capacity expect good commute vehicle unrealistic price realistically battery pack price drop add healthy profit manufacture owner paying bit offset price cost mile fuel cell battery fcev
