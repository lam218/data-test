Credit: Imperial College London The National Physical Laboratory (NPL) has recently assisted Imperial College London to investigate the design, fabrication and testing of waveguides manufactured using 3D-printing techniques, by providing the underpinning metrology needed to determine their electromagnetic performance. Metallic rectangular waveguides (or waveguides, for short) are commonly used to propagate electromagnetic waves from point to point due t","m_szDocBody":"printing microwave circuit nick ridler
