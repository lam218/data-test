November 24th, 2014 by Zachary Shahan Â  Originally published on Planetsave . As I wrote a couple of weeks ago, as a percentage of total car sales, no auto manufacturer is selling more electric cars than BMW (not counting 100%-electric companies like Tesla Motors). The percentage (4.9%) is even more than double what Nissan has achieved this year (2.1%). Of course, in many respects, Tesla Motors is the leader in the electric vehicle market. But one of its main goals is to stimulate greater EV enthusiasm and faster EV rollouts among the largest automakers in the world.
