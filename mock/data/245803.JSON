Many technologies have been tested in the field or been fully installed, but their real-world applications have created constant questions around a number of fixed themes: the three-points concern cost, technology, and potential environmental impact, as well as the need for specific regulation and end-of-life ","m_szDocBody":"debate energy storage utterly misse point debate energy storage utterly misse point chris dalby posted wed debate energy storage technology prove longterm woefully misguided technology tested field fully installed realworld application created constant question number fixed theme threepoint concern cost technology potential environmental impact specific regulation endoflife management here engineer run dilemma energy storage technology difficult energy storage method current stage development produce amount power energy required costeffective price however passing judgement energy storage equation simply incorrect all expect renewable energy provide onesizefitsall solution move fossil fuel wind farm suitable areas wind current southern mexico photovoltaic plant found traction sunkissed region california type resource technology application all ability operator connect small setup grid solar installation private home skyrocket expect energy storage technology highly shortterm option turn true leader pack year researcher university illinois announced creation lithiumion battery time powerful comparable batterieswhich break paradigm energy source wonderful advance that found commercially viable future generation smart phone charged faster power single highenergy application medical equipment however accelerated output lithiumion battery technology happen gridscale level require counter problem country germany chemical energy storage answer percent renewable future involve electrolysis create hydrogen methane extra energy generated renewable plant wind solar gunter ebert fraunhofer institute solar energy system option largescale storage vision large storage facility serve hydrogen converted vehicle fuel cell methane gas grid serve heat power chemical energy storage gaining traction hydrogen made electricity pumped germany gas network again presumptuous advance resolving energy storage debate research progresse equally viable form energy storage occur give consumer single family national grid operator lacking renewable energy offering long choice determine size storage applicability solution need house owner small community opt diffuse storage option number small storage unit local area largescale operator public transport company prefer rely centralised network comprised vast storage facility final problem current energy storage debate tendency judge method costeffectiveness merit technology scientific development costeffectiveness calculated link technology paired with energy storage renewable energy plant good new week report swiss bank ubs showed linked development energy storage solar power electric vehicle changing economic power generation ubs predict return investment unsubsidized purchase electric vehicle coupled rooftop solar installation battery storage drop year europe smart distribution network precisely manage usage allocation electricity allowing electric car charged night sun power house daylight hour improved battery store power residential use new met cheer office national grid operator show quest holy grail energy storage doomed fail chris dalby oilpricecom ","m_szGeo1":"United Kingdom","m_szSourceType":"source_industry","m_szSrcUrl":"http://oilprice.com/Energy/Energy-General/Why-The-Debate-Over-Energy-Storage-Utterly-Misses-The-Point.html","m_Places":["Mexico","California","Germany","Europe"],"m_People":["Chris Dalby","Gunter Ebert"],"m_Companies":["Many Technologies","University Of Illinois","Fraunhofer Institute","Solar Energy","Swiss Bank","Ubs"],"m_BiGrams":["energy storage","debate energy","storage technology","renewable energy"],"m_TriGrams":["debate energy storage","energy storage technology"],"m_SocialTags":[],"m_Topics":[],"m_Industry":[],"m_Technology":[],"m_BiCnt":[15,3,3,3],"m_TriCnt":[3,3],"m_iDocBodyWordCnt":399}
