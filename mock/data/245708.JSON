Being that 70D is 70 grand…I think Model 3 will probably come with a smaller battery pack than it, might be 50D or 60D at best. The smaller size is going to make up for heavier&cheaper materials, but at can’t make up for a smaller battery, and you can expect a smaller battery. If with Model 3 0-60 is below 6 seconds it’s still great for a 35k car, that has this level of practicality, and all of Tesla’s technology.
