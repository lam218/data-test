That’s a big plus for fleet managers in terms of maintenance, repair and replacement costs, and now a research team from Stanford University and the Department of Energy’s SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory has extended the savings by engineering a self-healing element into the EV battery itself. Inspired by biomimicry , the team has come up with a new polymer (a form of plastic) that can be coated onto the electrode in a lithium ion battery.
