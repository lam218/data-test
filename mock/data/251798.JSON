The Research Council of Norway’s RENERGI program Technical Director Dag Øvrebø is developing a new type of electric power supply unit with core components of a smart diesel reformer and a tolerant fuel cell. The system is environmentally friendly and flexible; the unit could be a serious contender in the market for generators in electric ve","m_szDocBody":"fuel cell run regular diesel biodiesel fuel cell
