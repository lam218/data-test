Technology changes fast these days. How many iterations of cell phones or computers have we now lived through? How quickly have music-playing mediums changed? But there’s a big difference between incremental changes in technology and “disruptive” technology shifts. A transition from cassette tapes to CDs was one thing, but a transition to MP3 players was something very different. Even with a shift to digital cameras, we saw that a giant like Kodak could go under due to a slow reaction","m_szDocBody":"manufacturer understand disruption technology transition originally published

competitor easy ride fact retake market important michael important toyota honda oust ford chrysler ownership car market mike shurtleff small car michael toyota making made better arent competing tesla ford deja again mike shurtleff small car first better ill give that deja toyota winning again language isnt clear dont agree youre saying toyota hit good quality market evs leave icevs behind evs invading market rapidly hevs did hevs beat icevs cost dealer complicated evs beat icevs cost some question when oil stay saudis afford long running national deficit back couple year fracking start
