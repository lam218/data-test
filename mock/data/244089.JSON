At this year’s January 2014 Detroit Auto Show, however, we were told the battery swapping plans were on the back-burner .  We didn’t hear much about the upcoming Model X electric SUV , except that it, too, was delayed.  There wasn’t any news on the ( maybe it will, maybe it won’t be called ) Model E compact, either. What’s going on over at the house that Musk built?
