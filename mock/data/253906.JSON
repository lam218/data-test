Brown University chemist Shouheng Sun and his students have developed the new material—a graphene sheet covered by cobalt and cobalt-oxide nanoparticles—that can catalyze the oxygen reduction reaction nearly as well as platinum does and i","m_szDocBody":"fuel cell catalyst offer cheap alternative platinum fuel cell catalyst offer cheap alternative platinum futurity posted tue new inexpensive catalyst hydrogen fuel cell put platinum business researcher whove developed alternative cobalt graphene cobaltoxide brown university chemist shouheng sun student developed materiala graphene sheet covered cobalt cobaltoxide nanoparticlesthat catalyse oxygen reduction reaction platinum substantially durable material reduction performance nonplatinum catalyst shaojun guo postdoctoral researcher sun lab lead paper published today international edition angewandte chemie oxygen reduction reaction occur cathode side hydrogen fuel cell oxygen function electron sink stripping electron hydrogen fuel anode creating electrical pull current running electrical device powered cell reaction require catalyst platinum one sun expensive limited supply dont lot fuel cell special purpose scientist unable develop viable alternative researcher including sun guo developed catalyst reduce amount platinum required effective catalyst platinum remain elusive graphenecobalt material promising candidate yet researcher say catalyst made precious metal close matching platinum property lab test performed sun team showed graphenecobalt material bit slower platinum oxygen reduction reaction started reaction going material reduced oxygen faster pace platinum related article rural alaska show wind energy installation catalyst proved stable degrading slowly platinum time hour testing graphenecobalt catalyst performing percent initial capacity platinum catalyst team tested performed percent amount time cobalt abundant metal readily fraction platinum cost graphene oneatomthick sheet carbon atom arranged honeycomb structure developed year graphene renowned strength electrical property catalytic potential selfassembly often graphene nanoparticle material made growing nanoparticle directly graphene surface process problematic making catalyst sun say difficult control size shape composition nanoparticle say sun team selfassembly method gave control material property first dispersed cobalt nanoparticle graphene separate solution solution combined pounded sound wave make mixed thoroughly caused nanoparticle attach evenly graphene single layer maximise potential particle involved reaction related article electric car dont future material pulled solution centrifuge dried exposed air layer atomic cobalt nanoparticle oxidised forming shell cobaltoxide help protect cobalt core researcher control thickness cobaltoxide shell heating material degree celsius varying amount time heating longer increased thickness shell way finetune structure combination top performance case found onenanometer shell cobaltoxide optimised catalytic property sun team optimistic study material day suitable replacement platinum catalyst now comparable platinum alkaline medium sun say ready yet test ultimately sun say finding suitable nonplatinum catalyst key fuel cell laboratory phase production power source car device kevin staceybrown ","m_szGeo1":"United Kingdom","m_szSourceType":"source_industry","m_szSrcUrl":"http://oilprice.com/Alternative-Energy/Fuel-Cells/New-Fuel-Cell-Catalyst-Offers-Very-Cheap-Alternative-to-Platinum.html","m_Places":["Alaska"],"m_People":["Shaojun Guo","Angewandte Chemie","Guo","He","Kevin Stacey"],"m_Companies":["Brown University"],"m_BiGrams":["fuel cell","hydrogen fuel","oxygen reduction","reduction reaction","sun team","sun say"],"m_TriGrams":["oxygen reduction reaction"],"m_SocialTags":[],"m_Topics":[],"m_Industry":[],"m_Technology":[],"m_BiCnt":[6,3,3,3,3,3],"m_TriCnt":[3],"m_iDocBodyWordCnt":382}
