Making a good example of just how anticipated the 2016 model year of the Chevy Volt was, it’s been revealed that roughly 86% of all Chevy Volts sold during November 2015 were of the 2016 model year. This means that year-on-year sales are up around 48.2%, as compared to November 2014 — with 1,980 Volt deliveries being reported for the month (roughly 1,700 2016 model years). The new figures mean that sales during November were pretty close to those during October 2015 as well — which saw 2,035 units ","m_szDocBody":"chevy volt sale chevy volt originally published
