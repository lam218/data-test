minor drawback wind turbine bought company making long term decision electricity good electricity mike shurtleff totally nitpicking wind reduce oil hawaii island site point meant generalizable solar reducing oil oil producing mena country put german replace icevs increasing market faster hybrid thought prospect cost reduction pretty clear including battery cost reduction point clear market

measurement safety stat youre theyre expensive good experience mike shurtleff statement wildly misleading called admit honest providing source admitting fleet user incentive causing gasoline plugging fleet priuse however youre original statement this questioned make misleading statement begin with poor credibility opinion point people plugging given dont agree you part people plugging given managed weird exception study showed main reason people bough prius plugin hov access study showed werent plugged driven day example involve phevs suppose large percentage owner plug example involve prius smallest allelectric range phevs available mean dont lose plugging example case incentive unintended consequence working plugging vehicle representative normal behaviour credibility blown

washington study clear hole leaving larger picture reference record dont care plug not long purchase evs phevs continue improving increasing market scale theyll plugging probably day mint back picture combined exercise combined red sock good health earlier bottom line reduction oil require consumer action car purchase support wind wind completely unrelated oil use grid electricity wind wouldnt reduce shale oil consumption iota conversely wind million vehicle oil consumption down mike shurtleff require both extra electricity somewhere mint incorrect require vehicle extra electricity anywhere fact existing generation capacity building decade mike shurtleff learning curve cost reduction battery evs phevs lower cost icevs hvs exponential growth continue dominate light truck car sale decade replacement icevs occur decade now additional electricity source beside return economic growth replacement electricity plant mean wind solar sooner increased demand yes support million usa cant remember number big happen faster electricity wind solar storage cheaper then problem bobwallace million recent comment guessing million mint youre reading correctly decade evs sell itll decade capacity needed number off power million evs today generation amount easily served idle night capacity teslas supercharger battery reduce demand charge fill night beside wind generation growing far faster demand already bobwallace teslas supercharger battery that ive written reliable source mint okay battery yet tesla rolling supercharger site time bobwallace existing electricity infrastructure national resource sufficient capacity fuel nation car pickup truck suvs million light duty fleet about million vehicle daily drive mile average wind farm line add oversupply late night capacity evs

renewable growth bobwallace true nrel stated car light truck evs charge existing unused capacity transmission switching fossil fuel large extent wed unused coal capacity mint higher thought youre right theoretical situation zero reality many year building renewable rate order magnitude faster demand require mike shurtleff thank missed that read bob correct fleet user completely reimbursed gas
