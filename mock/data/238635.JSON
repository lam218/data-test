January 14th, 2016 by Mike Barnard   One of the questions that gets left out of press about Uber and other ridesharing companies is whether they are increasing or decreasing carbon and pollution emissions. It turns out that they seem to be bad for the environment. Luckily, there are a couple of obvious policies which can deal with this. While the data is sketchy at present, there seem to be three factors where ridesharing has negative impacts on overall transportation emissions: More vehicles being idled and with ‘dead’ mileage Vehicles with poorer emissions displ","m_szDocBody":"uber climate friendly mike barnard question left press aboutuber ridesharing company increasing decreasing carbon pollution emission turn bad
