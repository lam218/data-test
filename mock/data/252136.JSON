Photo: UNDP The International Energy Agency (IEA) consistently entertains much too pessimistic assumptions about the growth potential and cost development of solar power,  writes Terje Osmundsen, Senior Vice President of the Norwegian-based international solar power company Scatec Solar. According to Osmundsen, the cost assumptions used by the IEA are 100% higher than even current market prices. He notes that as a result of the IEA’s misleading information, policymakers are under the false impression that the spread of solar pow","m_szDocBody":"iea underestimate solar industry terje osmundsen
