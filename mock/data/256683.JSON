A small, 1.2-kilowatt solar system priced at around $4,000 will cover charging costs for an electric vehicle for up to 40 years.” For $4,000 you can buy your ‘gas’ for the next 40 years. For the next forty years you will be producing the power for your EV for $8.33 a month.  Those are fixed dollars, not dollars that will rise with inflation, the $8.33 per month is locked in. The $185 per month that ICEV owners will be paying for gas?  In forty years, based on past inflation will cost you $1,027. Let’s use historical inflation rates to look forward to fort","m_szDocBody":"anonymous emphasise this small kilowatt solar system priced cover charging cost electric vehicle year buy gas year forty year producing power month fixed dollar dollar rise inflation month locked month icev owner paying gas forty year based past inflation cost let historical inflation rate forward forty year price gas price electricity price gas forty year price electricity forty year forty year buying power today dollar price latte charge month annual basis gas electricity what love that yes curmudgeon inverter repair way tree trimmed back advance grousing breath wind taking natural step number gas annual cost annually median increase cost gasoline average average annual gasoline cost initial cost saving lifetime completely pay electric car buy house location park place put solar panel reality option fuel price notwithstanding petrol unavailable replacement sought satisfy transportation energy demand biofuel turn electric event instal solar panel charge compensate power grid storage way great article anonymous putting futurist hat rapid increase price fuel headed way weve pumped easy weve refined sweet stuff great distance including badly melted arctic deposit lot energy crack sludge wouldnt touched decade ago weve buyer coming market place china india create middle class consumer sooner price resume rising rising faster average inflation oil price pull them grow wheat grocery store oil now glad model oil tested poop hit air disperser wont invent system ground roll out ","m_szGeo1":"United States","m_szSourceType":"source_industry","m_szSrcUrl":"http://cleantechnica.com/2011/09/12/electric-vehicles-smart-grid-residential-solar-power-a-virtuous-circle-emerges/","m_Places":["China","India"],"m_People":[],"m_Companies":[],"m_BiGrams":["forty year"],"m_TriGrams":[],"m_SocialTags":[],"m_Topics":[],"m_Industry":[],"m_Technology":[],"m_BiCnt":[6],"m_TriCnt":[],"m_iDocBodyWordCnt":224}
