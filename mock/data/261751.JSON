Among the upheaval in the electricity system, the coming of solar “grid parity” means re-thinking incentives for solar energy. The success of solar is remarkable, no less because the amount of federal subsidy in absolute terms has been far less for renewable energy than for fossil fuel resources (see graphic below). 1 As the cost of solar drops toward – and below – grid parity, the question i","m_szDocBody":"phase incentive grow solar energy john farrell decade solar electricity consumer cheaper energy rooftop utility
