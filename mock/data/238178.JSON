For years now we have been urged by governments and energy efficiency proponents to change to LED bulbs, moving away from the old-fashioned incandescent light bulbs which have barely seen a modification since they were invented by Thomas Edison in the late-1800s. However, new research published in the journal Nature Nanotechnology boasts the ability to improve the efficiency of the inc","m_szDocBody":"energysaving incandescent light bulb joshua hill thomas
