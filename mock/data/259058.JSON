By Bobby Magill Natural gas as a means to produce electricity is being hailed by the  Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change  as the fuel that can act as a “bridge” between carbon-heavy coal and zero-carbon renewables, helping to reduce humans’ impact on the climate. The idea is that burning natural gas involves fewer greenhouse gas emissions than burning coal. The IPCC in its  Working Group III report  says natural gas as a bridge fuel will only be effective if few gases escape into the atmosphere","m_szDocBody":"methane emission question gas bridge fuel
