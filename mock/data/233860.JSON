Engineers working on the 2016 Chevy Volt have used data collected from customers to design a follow-up to the best-selling plug-in car in America, and GM has detailed the first of those drivetrain improvements. Among the improvements is a lighter battery with more storage capacity, the result of a joint effort between supplier LG Chem and GM, which share a once-controversial battery factory. GM claims efficiency improvements shaved 30 pounds off the weight of the battery pack, while increasing storage capacity by about 20%.
