Ronald Brakels With 50 kilowatts of average power that’s going to be one slow bus.  But if the batteries had a high enough power output, or were replaced with ultracapacitors, it could work if its route involved a lot of stopping and starting which would let its energy storage top up. But, the biggest problem is, you know… money. James Is there a conflict of interest disclosure that should have been made at the top of the article?
