Town Rejects Solar Farm Amid Fears it Would ‘Suck Up All the Energy From the Sun’ “One of the more unusual claims came from Jane Mann, a retired science teacher, who is concerned that photosynthesis “would not happen” and the panels “would keep the plants from growing.” She said she has “observed areas near solar panels where the plants are brown and dead because they did not get enough sunlight.” JamesWimberley Ah, but the plants get free fertiliser fro all the dead birds killed by the wind turbines.
