By Chris DeMorro Tesla Motors is exclusively an electric car maker, with Elon Musk expressing disdain for cars like the Chevy Volt and BMW i3, which pack gas-powered range-extenders. But Tesla may be working on a different kind of hybrid; a hybrid battery pack that could extend the range of cars like the Tesla Model S by up to 40%, allowing for 400 miles of driving between charges. A report by Global Equities Research shows that Tesla recently filed patents  20130187591  and  20130181511","m_szDocBody":"tesla patent mile battery pack metalair lithiumion battery originally posted
