Ronald Brak It would be more economically efficient to properly price externalities than to provide subsidies.  This would mean a carbon price equal to the cost of removing CO2 emitted by burning fossil fuels from the atmosphere.  As I am an optimist I think a carbon price of $50 per tonne of CO2 or possibly less might be sufficient.  Of course coal has a lot more externalities than just CO2 emissions so it will be priced out of the energy market, although existing coal plants could be used as peak or load following plants for some time.  Bob_Wallace I suspect ","m_szDocBody":"ronald brak
