Right: Five hours later, the smaller cracks have healed. Credit: C. Wang et al, Nature Chemistry Researchers have made the first battery electrode that heals itself, opening a new and potentially commercially viable path for making the next generation of lithium ion batteries for electric cars, cell phones and other devices.
