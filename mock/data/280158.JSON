And smart investors are positioning for it. We Are Reaching Peak Energy Demand, BP Data Suggests by Tyler Durden - Jun 24, 2015 6:00 PM Submitted by Gail Tverberg via Our Finite World blog , Some people talk about peak energy (or oil) supply. They expect high prices and more demand than supply.Â Other people talk about energy demand hitting a peak many years from now, perhaps when most of us have electric cars. Neither of these views is correct.
