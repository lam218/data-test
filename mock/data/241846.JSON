The day after Christmas, I had the chance to talk with Mike Tinskey, Ford’s global director of vehicle electrification and vehicle infrastructure, about the concept car and other electric vehicle matters. Below are a number of details about the Ford C-Max Solar Energi Concept that you won’t find anywhere else, as well as some other Ford electric vehicle matters. Enjoy!

arnenl leave car window open car left charging hot inside arnenl hot normal roof insolation converted electricity heat jouni valkonen concentrating len increase insolation tracking optimise angle importantly traditional car rooftop designed reflect large portion solar radiation possible remember correctly teslas roof reflect solar radiation away solar panel designed absorb solar radiation solar panel roof cook car hope demonstrate prototype committing commercialise marion mead firt liar year ford motor similar concept magnifying glass patentpending system track sun move east west

year average drop hour number solar company california estimate electricity production solar misleading outright ly ford detriment concept omega centauri yes missing here surface collect sunlight metre squared wouldnt close kwhour suspect car parked solar concentrating structure concentrate sunlight roof there overheating issue diagram graphic depicting love idea adding plugin roof sound bogus this sound pricey panel cheap enough adding plugin make sense for recharge work power vehicle valuable power grid cost competitive grid make sense vehicle assuming condtition met cost mounting car low amount wasted car battery fully charged anymore minimised arnenl shouting devote time reading marion mead read article part analysis incorrect arnenl canopy fresnel lense concentrate light aperture

found source confusion marion mead price solar option delivering watt estimate efficiency solar panel arent cheap arnenl top lnie sunpower cell price found panel vat marion mead estimate that including installation solar based profit granted cost ford solar option evaluated life car usual year warrantied life panel price recoup money saving electricity realistically panel produce worth electricity time metering price year simple payoff realistic pricing year payoff finance charging above take infinity payoff power produce omega centauri real vaue charge grid power isnt not pay grid power charge plug plugin work burn fuel that pay premium power charge power available solar vehicle roof make sense except coolness factor connected grid juice created thrown away marion mead erev approach ibmw practical solar car roof top generator supply electricity grid down zachary shahan unfortunately mike cmax solar energi concept early concept phase estimate price survey reader with marion mead guess watt system installed car option cost prefer buy foldable solar panel system camping hunting small watt system stay put week time recharge battery trip back home deploy portable solar system dont pollute visit back hunting fishing ground dont smell diesel engine gasoline hunting driveby resource spend building car port long wide their moveable thingy essentially plastered efficient solar module peak hour kwh sunpower cell youd kwh shed kidding here base roof covered solar panel each cost sunpower module wattage car isnt parked collected power elsewhere panel car roof arent standalone recharge hot theyre air cooled reduce efficiency the solar concentration make worse pretty useless idea john investigative journalism great new industry finally beginning mobile solar option evs off enthusiasm conrad clement yeah john contributor sense suspect scoop reading line tell ford isnt keen producing electric car denoted bob lutzs statement pushed electric truck waste time
