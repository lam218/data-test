Worth noting up front, is that the debut of the two new offerings make a pretty strong case for the argument that the company is moving away from its earlier (supposed anyways) embrace of hydrogen fuel cell technologies and towards electric vehic","m_szDocBody":"hyundai tucson dieselelectric plugin hybrid concept unveiled geneva jame ayre hyundais latest electric offering tucson hybrid concept
