With that in mind let’s take a look at a new advanced energy storage development announced by our friends over at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory. PNNL has been working on bringing down the cost of sodium-β batteries (that’s β for beta). Sodium-β batteries are widely perceived to be the key to advanced energy storage for
