Kieron McKindle I used to be a huge fan of this technology, until I discovered that water vapor is a main Green House Gas. Having millions of these pumping water vapor into the atmosphere will ultimately be realized as a bad idea. Especially, when we realize that the water vapor can and must be reclaimed for reuse in static FC sites. Ultimately, batteries will be replaced with ultra-capacitors (power-walls on steroids), and at this point the concept of mobile FC will end. Add to this the concept of H2 from water via renewables and the reclama","m_szDocBody":"horizon now speculative kieron mckindle huge fan technology discovered water vapour main green house gas million
