Share this Post Renewable Energy vs. Fossil Fuels:  Sprint or Cross Country? Last week Tesla Motors’ (ticker: TSLA) innovation-infused CEO Elon Musk unveiled the latest offering from the all-electric auto maker: a new home battery. This battery is an enlarged version of the battery used in Tesla electric cars and would be placed in homes to store electrical energy.
