With these new solar cells, every blue photon that is absorbed can generate up to 30 percent more current than with current technologies. The external quantum efficiency is the measure of how many photons are converted into electrons within a device. “While traditional semiconductors only produce one electron from each photon, nanometer-sized crystalline m","m_szDocBody":"highefficiency quantum dot solar cell developed jame ayre solar cell external quantum efficiency eqe exceed percent photon energy solar range created solar cell blue photon absorbed generate percent current current technology external quantum efficiency measure photon converted electron device traditional semiconductor produce electron photon nanometersized crystalline material quantum dot avoid restriction developed promising photovoltaic material avs new release note increase efficiency quantum dot harvesting energy lost heat conventional semiconductor amount heat loss reduced resulting energy funnelled creating electrical current researcher made process named multiple exciton generation meg blue photon absorbed create percent electric current technology allow multiple exciton generation work efficiently splitting greater portion energy higherenergy photon this researcher create eqe percent photon prove concept functional actual working device joseph luther senior scientist nrel believe meg technology direction current solar cell technology expensive completely compete nonrenewable energy source technology employing meg demonstrate scientist engineer converting solar photon electricity constantly changing luther said editor note expensive dont account health environmental cost fossil fuel and taking account solar cost competitive energy option region now chance dramatically increase efficiency module result solar panel cheaper nonrenewable energy source luther add reposted solar love full permission cleantechnicas completely free electric car report electric car early adopter follower want youd attend electric vehicle solar power event conducted cleantechnica date hottest cleantech new subscribing free cleantech newsletter eye sectorspecific new also free solar energy newsletter electric vehicle newsletter wind energy newsletter tag efficiency solar power quantum dot post nrel quantom dot quantum dot solar cell quantum dot solar cell quantum dot quantum dot solar power solar cell research solar panel research solar research jame ayre background predominantly geopolitic history obsessive interest pretty everything early life spent imperial free city dortmund jame river ruhr cofbuokheim attended university astnide briefly considered entering coal mining business write living broad variety subject ranging science politic military history renewable energy follow work google related post tax credit extension impact renewable deployment electricity emission stan stein hmmmmokkkkkk yrs the life solar panel coal cost equivalent amount coal produse average size home systemuse wattsabout month jerseyeach panel including proportionate amount individual instal small component racking laboris divided watt panel equal panel approx watt company charge account inflation price coal rate increase yrsit doubtful solar expensive rate increase coal price general business cost inflation etc cost solar system allowance inverter yrsof from leave costplus future rate increasesplease put pencil isnt wanting renewable energypropoganda real analogy people understand bill leaven technology large scale manufacture applied flexible substrate literally rolled roofing material change game everywhere jigar shah phrase divorced reality joseph luther current solar cell technology expensive completely compete nonrenewable energy source technology employing meg demonstrate scientist engineer converting solar photon electricity constantly changing luther said edward kerr jigar exception solar expensive renewable coal instance watt watt basis bit cheap exigent cost burning coal infinitely expensive apparently information profit currant energy paradigm way quote ronald brak jigar shah disagree phrase divorced reality edward kerr noted stand corrected misread post back ron calculate true cost renewable resource war polution increased rate autism due mercury coal choice ","m_szGeo1":"United States","m_szSourceType":"source_industry","m_szSrcUrl":"http://cleantechnica.com/2012/10/27/new-high-efficiency-quantum-dot-solar-cells-developed/","m_Places":["Free City","Dortmund","New Jersey","Ron"],"m_People":["Dot Solar","James Ayre","Joseph Luther","Stan Stein","Bill Leavens","Jigar Shah","Edward Kerr","Ronald Brak"],"m_Companies":["First Solar","University Of Astnide","Google"],"m_BiGrams":["quantum dot","solar cell","dot solar","nonrenewable energy","energy source","solar panel","solar power"],"m_TriGrams":["nonrenewable energy source"],"m_SocialTags":[],"m_Topics":[],"m_Industry":[],"m_Technology":[],"m_BiCnt":[8,8,4,3,3,3,3],"m_TriCnt":[3],"m_iDocBodyWordCnt":508}
