call mentioned large transformer order backlog produced facility active quoting activity opportunity patrick oleary million backlog elana elana wood bofa merrill lynch okay you update test measurement electric vehicle opportunity programme win relationship christopher kearney well talk think publicly talked chevy volt daimler smart car united state europe big opportunity interesting market opportunity longer term company lot develop product continue develop performance continue improve extend pretty nice position unique relationship globally key oes dealer world step key provider good start programme have opportunity elana wood bofa merrill lynch okay belowtheline question reduced full year guidance equity earning egs million outlook deteriorated couple month wondering driving this patrick oleary well tornado comment chris made experienced fire south milwaukee foundry joint venture impacted service delivery somewhat development revenue brazilian acquisition moved fast hoped item
