If that name rings a bell, you probably saw the video I published about him talking about the same matter in Abu Dhabi earlier this year. If not, I am including that video again for you below. A lot of people like to toss around their armchair ideas for how to integrate renewables into the grid , or how it “ can’t be done .” Boris knows
