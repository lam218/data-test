The new ones may be more expensive, but the world will adapt. Prices will rise and people will learn to do more with less. Everything will work out in the end. It is only a matter of time and a little faith. In fact, the Financial Times published an article recent","m_szDocBody":"standard economic model workour economy network tuesday follow follow storey energy economy obvious common sense one source

industry indirectly enable higher food production higher population extract oil ground process oil natural gas refining oil energy job created oil industry people job spend money good service sort indirectly leading greater availability job oil industry oil price important lower price affordable product oil car order consumer purchase car operate gasoline debt buy car thus extraction oil tightly tied buildup debt oil producer pay taxe type level government government oil exporting country tend percentage revenue taxe oil nonexporting country taxe oil tend high consumer pay taxe gasoline taxe job created oil lead tax revenue wage earner pay income taxe government build road partly additional car operate road gasoline diesel partly repair damage truck travel oil extraction site oil extraction process going school medical facility care worker family educate worker needless say effect well existence oil marketplace affect market price oil burning oil affect climate tend acidify ocean difficulty substituting oil sense oil deeply imbedded operation economy talk electricity replacing oil oil involvement economy pervasive possibly replace everything electricity replace gasoline private passenger automobile change reduce demand hydrocarbon chain length reduce demand slice oil mixture shorter longer chain hydrocarbon unaffected price gasoline drop making chinese buyer

shorter chain huge waste gasoline valuable resulting gase replacing taxe directly indirectly related unused gasoline price electricity electricpowered vehicle adjusted cover foregone tax revenue liquid substitute oil made low priced highpriced substitute oil lowpriced substitute part problem highpriced substitute leave room taxe government part problem customer afford highpriced oil product cut back discretionary expenditure economy contract layoff discretionary sector again government find difficult collect tax revenue economy networked system world economic system networked system dome

dome collapse wrong history show civilization collapsed past research case joseph tainter research diminishing return played important role collapse past civilization diminishing return problem adding worker didnt add amount output respect food situation reached population grew large piece arable land degradation soil fertility play role well today reaching diminishing return respect oil supply evidenced rising cost oil extraction occurring removed easy extract oil move expensive extract oil effect system efficient worker resource type needed produce barrel oil barrel oil term work say move car heat produce unchanged worker producing less opposite efficiency peter turchin sergey nefedov research nature past collapse documented book called secular cycle economy clear piece land discover approach irrigation mean discover expand number people live area resulting economy grow year population started catching resource availability period stagflation followed typically year economy continue grow bumped increasing obstacle wage disparity grew wage worker lagged debt grew eventually collapse occurred period year often population died off intercycle period followed resource regenerated civilization arise shape typical secular cycle based work peter turkin sergey nefedov secular cycle major issue past collapse difficulty funding government service part problem wage common worker low making difficult collect taxe part government problem cost solve increasingly complex problem society today cost include unemployment insurance bailing bank age past included larger army conquer land resource resource depleted today situation situation isnt different economy started growing early time started fossil fuel technology allowed them oil fossil fuel depleting quickly valuable use including transportation agriculture construction mining raw material produce good day economy hit stagflation early oil price began spike now symptom distressingly symptom civilization prior beginning collapse networked system weak point oil exporter government collapse government soviet union oil price low fact oil price risen contributing unrest middle east oil importer spike oil price lead recession government funding debt expanding infrastructure fixe dont done promise pension healthcare failing financial system debt default major problem economic system start shrinking debt needed oil price contagion energy product short supply way example businesse rely electricity oil unavailable say oil supply part ship good customer business close business closure demand energy product business use electricity natural gas drop time direct energy product produce energy product mentioned previously contribute contagion unfortunately operating economy liebig law minimum rule word required element missing system doesnt work businesse financing pay employee bank closed businesse close worker laid off inability afford energy product economist call lack demand bring system down modelling current economy look model energy system economy expected work model match current situation well growth continue past pretty clear model inadequate revision growth estimate downward finite world growth rate continue foreverwe run resource place people stand networked nature system explain system grow growth continue indefinitely rising cost producing energy product doesnt matter global world compete price good service cost producing good service depend cost energy product making good service wage paid worker producing service government healthcare overhead cost financing cost part problem globalisation competing warm countriescountry receive free energy sun warmer europe free energy sun home built sturdily heat needed winter cost wage high country tend expensive healthcare system lower pension elderly government fix noncompetitive cost structure compared country reducing interest rate possible fact remainsit difficult country cold part world compete country warm part world making good cost competition problem worse price energy product rise competing cost heating requirement cold country add carbon taxe surcharge good imported warm country disparity warm country worse early year civilization warm country dominated world economy energy price rise situation occur price important warm countrycool country issue reason energy cost real good financial printed money important price energy economy important tied buy oil anther energy product such food energy cheap obtain energy energy huge ability work work obtained easily make good service compensate energy expensive benefit negative benefit compared work energy product provide result economic growth held back highpriced energy product kind supply demand lead higher price substitute major obstacle standard model working diminishing return respect oil supply recession government failure oil importer oil price rise civil unrest government failure oil exporter oil price dont rising isnt oil supply oil price rise followon effect oil price fall back again production ratio supposedly tell long produce oil natural gas coal current extraction rate ratio simply misleading real limit long economy function feedback loop related diminishing return person simply investment dollar required clear model doesnt work post iea investment report right wrong ipcc climate change model estimate future carbon emission networked nature energy system economy tend high post oil limit climate change fit energy payback period energy return energy invested life cycle analysis approaches efficiency energy production comparing energy process energy produced process way workthey show efficient producing oil coal natural gas move difficult extract resource worthwhile decision made similar device purchase
