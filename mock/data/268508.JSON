case opposing drag force increase square velocity power forcevelocity cube velocity however battery voltage remain same additional power increased current voltage increasing battery power time increase current time again simplifying battery losse related cell internal resistance power i^r increasing battery current time increase battery losse time produce heat bit viscous circle increased current lower battery voltage current needed etc battery hot shutdown expected cooling system massively overengineered suit unusual rare use appease fanboy robert haylar change keeping example doubling speed result time drag power loss voltage battery current increase time power currentvoltage increasing current time increase internal battery losse time because power current^resistance

listening world jeffhre retitled chris happened here wilibald oplatek car didnt minute misleading alaa agree point early morning noon couldnt reach minute traffic stop him world think germany fantastic road reality lane france lane there speed limit germany part limiting traffic speed limit tesla easily deal that nakedchimp autobahn upgraded lane lived thuringia hermsdorfer kreuz area big

usually overtake truck lane faster left lane faster car careful then miss order obeyed back germany autobahn didnt drove pretty speed car overtake you rightmost lane left lane pretty free fast car lane overtake possible fast car fast driving lane like order really naturally time theyre drive limit short odd case slow car sitting lane time here drive left hand side road overtaking lane right left annoying speedlimit dangerous discipline consideration people here sry rant correct average drive correctly called drover ivor oconnor region damn american military convoy kilometre long mile hour bullshit slowing down youd common decency autobahn opposite omega centauri noticed too presume car wasnt destroyed battery management system wouldnt experiment continue chris demorro hey guy wrote editor changed title original simply tesla model drive mph minute amazing addition single word change tone eddie correction appreciated chris driver isnt driving german version car bjrn live norway drove minute last minute power limiter short time which didnt prevent driving speed exmsft max speed offgridman didnt bother yesterday thinking already comment coming contact adjustment title nukreactor paid chris why misinformation whore media telivised new profit misguiding public point ppl vote rightsaka brainwashing prop good example bobwallace line nukreactor remove comment expose truth dont freedom speech huh nukreactor move china limit control aspect public media nukreactor line called terrorist stripping basis country place bobwallace limit acceptable site start acting grownup away dag johansen energy density hard matter illegal drive fast place mint mph consumption motor heat isnt pretty manageable amount heat remove car minute speed eveee mean right power mph mint thank added missing exmsft power required overcome air resistance factor speed cubed power discussion reasonable there factor also youd expect perfect car quadruple consumption level ground double speed drag scale square velocity bit omega centauri yes assuming drag coefficient doesnt change velocity energy unit distance scale squared power scale cube reported number low marion mead forgot math
