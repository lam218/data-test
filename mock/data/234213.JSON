First of all, starting with the biggie, due to the use of some fancy space technology mumbo jumbo, the Tesla Model S (with the proper tech) can now accelerate from 0 to 60 mph in 2.8 seconds (that’s up from its previously insane 3.2 seconds ). It was already the quickest electric car on the planet — er, the quickest mass-market car of any type on the planet. But now it is literally a monster. (Literally.).
