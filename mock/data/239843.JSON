Hill   The American Wind Energy Association released a new report on Thursday which concludes that adding wind power to the US electricity grid can help the country cut carbon pollution while still keeping the lights on. “Americans want energy security, clean air, and a more reliable energy system,” said American Wind Energy Association (AWEA) CEO Tom Kiernan. “Diversifying our energy mix with wind helps us achieve all of these goals at once.” The report, “Wind energy helps build a more reliable and balanced electric","m_szDocBody":"wind energy american light awea joshua hill american wind
