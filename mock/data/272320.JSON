I think the magic number is ~200 miles.  That would make for a 500 mile day with about 50 minutes spend charging. When we start talking about 300, 400, 500 mile ranges we risk estimating very high purchase prices to cover the extra range.  And we add on weight that we  just donâ€™t need to haul around. Assuming supercharger bays are about $35,000 it makes more sense to me to go with moderate range batteries, sell cars for less, and give people plenty places to charge when they take a long trip.
