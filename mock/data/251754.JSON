But on the other hand, AWD would then be a viable option… Peter Mortensen I don’t think 48kWh can give you a realistic 200 miles easily. Nissan Leaf gets EPA 73 miles with 24kWh (146 miles per 48kWh), Tesla Model S 60 gets EPA 208 miles with 60kWh (166 miles per 48kWh) and Tesla Model S 85 gets EPA 265 miles with 85 kWh (150 miles per 48kWh)). 200 miles in Model E on 48kWh means A LOT of improvement on efficiency and with the already low drag coefficient and drivetrain efficiency, it’s hard to see how to reach such number.
