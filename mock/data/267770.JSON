It is the same technology as one that came on line in Spain last year that can ship power 15 hours a day by using molten salt storage – both as the carrier and as the storage. It was developed by  (literally) rocket scientists  in the 90s with a pilot project that proved it works. First, I had to know: SK: I’ve ","m_szDocBody":"interview molten salt storage safe store heat month susan kraemer week chance talk skype kevin smith ceo solarreserve building world largest
