The problem is the assumption in the question, which treats GM as a single entity capable of holding a single opinion. I suspect there are decision makers within GM who want the car to succeed, and those who would prefer business as usual – with no threat posed to existing revenue streams. There are also the shareholders to consider.

possible solid market data price demand supplier cost etc solid demand forecasting theyll position negotiate deal battery supplier bankable deal like battery supplier prepared invest required megascale production facility giga tera sod let build yottafactory huge resource disposal reckon ramp production pretty quickly potentially smart move early here doesnt work out well havent lost anything needed compliance car case zachary shahan hey arent land cricket yeah good point otoh ramping nationwide superfast charging network take time isnt starting that well robwithab indeed metaphor full day end conclusive result zachary shahan hahaha freddy fast charging interesting topic watch coming year mile evs available relevant mainstream time demand hockey stick car sell well automaker

youre bolt right yeah man cool ill hook cool minute session normal sweet man thank cheech chong charger coming food market you zachary shahan aha tim thought realised kyle vape writer block take coming fast kyle kyle field wow man style glad storey sounded head tim make mistake coworker diligence dissemination accurate information important business climate salvage zachary shahan man teslas supercharger network absolute home run double triple apology nonnorth american baseball metaphor fan sport personally make good metaphor shane ive born base thought hit triple zachary shahan video help sense person good imho tesla model sharp normal make mainstream people feel fine buying also realised orange bolt picture write bolt robwithab possibility adaptor supercharging tesla network understanding theyre voltage theoretically possible case make sense make deal tesla meantime time network built out viable model largescale commercial network emerge joshua engineering wise definitely cheap built practically tesla super charger major strategic advantage them reason share bobwallace tesla offered share supercharger system car manufacturer interested requirement afaik company economic model cost folded selling price car tesla interested hourly rental metered charging system joshua super pro zachary shahan yes made year ago shocking company partnered yet havent longrange evs anyway typically pride but yes eager european company guessing aston martin bobwallace yeah remember founder tesla rich spend money lifestyle goal move personal transportation petroleum tesla premier vehicle manufacturing company survive tesla primarily catalyst purpose greatly speed reaction happened slower tom capon requirement car charge rate teslas dont car blocking station full capacity mean practical standpoint car mile battery which bolt has superhighcurrent wiring which bolt apparently have zachary shahan challenging eveee surely chime this impression automaker design car charging capability compatible teslas supercharger sound hasnt wrong point partner tesla imho prideful invitation tesla frank right wanted cut corner slide tesla price mile range shocked tesla attempt medium priced vehicle year there make lot car steven musk listed requirement charge rate equal faster existing tesla insure slow charging car backup car waiting charge share cost operating charging
