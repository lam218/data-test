To answer this question we only have to look at the activity around batteries and the talk of grid independence, which is pervading all corners of the energy industry. Solar with Battery Hybrid inverters (formerly known as Grid-Tie with Battery Backup or what the CEC calls multi-mode) have actually been around for a long time.
