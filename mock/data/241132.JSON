New report finds solar will be cheaper than wholesale electricity prices across Europe by 2030 – without the need for any technological breakthroughs. The implications for fossil fuels are obvious – and means high renewable targets might reduce the energy costs, rather than increasing them. Solar generation costs are likely to fall below the average wholesale price of electricity across Europe by 2030, according to a new study, highlighting t","m_szDocBody":"solar unstoppable subsidy
