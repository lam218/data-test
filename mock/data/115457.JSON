sinter hardening achieved accelerated cooling post sintering induction hardening performance stated equal highly alloyed hybrid diffusionalloyed material nickel copper molybdenum franois chagnon rio tinto metal powder canada investigated effect postsintering cooling rate property diffusion bonded steel part made diffusion bonded powder exhibit heterogeneous microstructure depending carbon content diffusion bonded powder prealloyed molybdenum found display homogeneous distribution element compared diffusion bonded higher apparent hardness higher carbon faster cooling rate observed specimen made diffusion bonded powder prealloyed making steel highly suited sinter hardening application narsi chandrachud gkn sinter metal pvt ltd india discussed aspect relating induction hardening part advantage reported localised hardening low distortion excellent reproducibility modern machine automation easy integration production advantage induction hardening part localised hardening low distortion excellent reproducibility modern machine automation easy integration production courtesy gkn sinter metal pvt ltd india make part specific machine design process harmful environment efficient heating recirculation water soluble polymer based quenching solution process result minimum scaling reduced post heat treatment operation enable machining areas hardening main advantage possibility unalloyed steel stated cost part induction hardening lower compared material quench temper process flc material sinter hardening benefit induction hardening however challenge porosity sintered steel result decreased thermal conductivity leading reduced soaking action low temperature higher temperature gradient resulting higher thermal stresse heating slower cooling quenching porosity increase electrical resistivity leading larger heat penetration depth decreased magnetic permeability resulting greater penetration depth lower electrical efficiency hardenability structural homogeneity affected presence porosity problem solved steel part minimum density shape involving undercut spline gear teeth slot sharp corner etc higher energy input higher frequency equivalent wrought part higher graphite level comparison wrought product due reduced hardenability segregation graphite alloying element avoided temperature sintering favourable pore shape diffused microstructure tiwari consultant mumbai india
