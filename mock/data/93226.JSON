On the other hand, lithium has been the gold standard for energy storage in a slew of clean tech fields including electric vehicles and large-scale stationary batteries, but it’s beginning to bump up against some competition from other areas. By other areas we mean sodium batteries. You thought I was going to say fuel cells, right?.
