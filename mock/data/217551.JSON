capital allocation year ago future changed management structure business deal change patrick donald daniel well truth capital allocation closer year ago now andrew biggest challenge lack growth time therefore basically opportunity had taking recall growth rate time hoping range organic layering expectation acquisition growth based prior track record hitting range basically point opportunity investment triangle taking situation very selective shooting year ago huge slate opportunity selective situation allocating capital attentive point quick due huge slate opportunity andrew kuske crdit suisse research division followup selectivity driven return compression patrick donald daniel isnt interestingly enough talked year return compression matter fact largely unique part business maintain return fact bit back period time strategic positioning critically important that example liquid pipeline side corridor fort macmurray edmonton strong strategic positioning there make big entry business allowed basically maintain return course cts think produce return incentive tolling agreement past add matthew bringing mic you add gas distribution business return significantly year ago largely basis point uplift incentive tolling deal matthew akman scotia capital inc research division matthew akman scotia capital question recent acquisition tonbridge move electricity transmission enbridge business company wondering opportunity business multiyear period enbridge bring business obviously core strength business synergistic organisation learn business electricity order flourish that patrick donald daniel well think all opportunity side mentioned year ago before result working renewable business noticed transmission system shortfall location north america matter fact biggest consideration renewable project limited transmission system longterm ppa limited inability power market significant constraint due diligence noticed number areas limit hence opportunity power transmission business involve long linear construction project fit kind doing acquiring away working landowner construction project linear confined space plant skill bring pretty obvious tonbridge
