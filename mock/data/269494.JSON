Call it the great debate. A new technology that threatens to disrupt a century-old status quo in a trillion dollar industry. Battery storage, teamed with solar, is predicted to do to the energy industry what the internet did to media and mobiles did to the telephone hand set. Thereâ€™s really not much debate about that. Consumers, technology developers, retailers, network operators and generators all recognise it. Even the politicians do.
