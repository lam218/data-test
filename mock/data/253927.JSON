The best catalyst for efficiency is platinum, the rare, expensive, and beautiful silvery metal.  Other ideas are in research and some early claims are looking positive, but ","m_szDocBody":"increasing efficiency platinum fuel cell increasing efficiency platinum fuel cell brian westenhaus posted sun fuel cell are some nirvana portable mobile energy production problem catalyst tear hydrogen atom part needed generate electricity bedevil progress widespread commercial marketability catalyst efficiency platinum rare expensive beautiful silvery metal ideas research early claim positive platinum king platinum stay top cost cut longevity increased research team cornell energy material centre important step forward chemical process create platinumcobalt nanoparticle platinum enriched shell show improved catalytic activity work addresse catalyst problem fuel cell pretty steady state energy production device throttle instant powerup power demand customary variance needed for electric vehicle use variance storage battery capacitor power burst energy recovery surge sluggish sensation fuel cell working isnt make driver happy all hctor abrua chamot professor chemistry chemical biology believe cornell work real significant improvement enhance catalysis cut cost factor five related article revolutionary improvement increase lithium ion battery capacity hydrogen fuel cell catalyst electrode crack hydrogen atom component proton electron electron travel external circuit create electric current electrode catalyst combine incoming electron free proton oxygen form water current commercial fuel cell catalyst pure platinum platinum cobalt coparticle cornell cornell research team previously created nanoparticle palladiumcobalt alloy coated thin layer platinum worked pure platinum lower cost forming catalyst nanoparticle typically nanometer diameter distributed carbon support surface area react fuel abrua explain computer simulation catalytic reaction predicted increase catalytic activity platinum atom pushed bit strained deli wang postdoctoral researcher abruas group devised chemical process manufacture nanoparticle platinumcobalt alloy included annealing heating step randomly distributed atom alloy form orderly crystal structure jumbled together metal atom arrange orderly lattice related article fuel cell catalyst offer cheap alternative platinum innovation absolutely key platinum atom layered particle line lattice pushed closer pure platinum resulting strain enhancing catalytic activity huolin xin graduate student muller group scanning tunnelling electron microscope confirm structure preliminary test nanoparticle supported lattice showed half time higher catalytic activity measured current flow similar particle disordered core time pure platinum catalyst durable fuel cell catalyst lose effectiveness platinum atom oxidised nanoparticle clump together decreasing surface area offer react fuel onoff cycle test cell catalytic activity cornell ordered lattice nanoparticle remained steady similar cobaltplatinum nanoparticle disordered core rapidly fell off ordered structure stable abrua said platinum skin bonded strongly ordered core disordered alloy fuse platinum nanoparticle clumping cycle result point very good said lead abrua xin coauthor include francis disalvo john newman professor chemistry chemical biology david muller professor applied engineering physic codirector kavli institute cornell nanoscale science paper structurally ordered intermetallic platinumcobalt coreshell nanoparticle enhanced activity stability oxygen reduction electrocatalyst published nature material lot claim made solving fuel cell catalyst problem commercial mass production scale taking place ideas platinum fuel cell technology manufacturing abrua commercial application needing platinum huge processing cost fuel cell larger market brian westenhaus ","m_szGeo1":"United Kingdom","m_szSourceType":"source_industry","m_szSrcUrl":"http://oilprice.com/Alternative-Energy/Fuel-Cells/Increasing-the-Efficiency-of-Platinum-Use-in-Fuel-Cells.html","m_Places":[],"m_People":["Brian Westenhaus","Hector Abruna","Chamot","Deli Wang","He","Wang","Francis Disalvo","John Newman","David Muller","Shell Nanoparticles"],"m_Companies":["Half Times","Kavli Institute","Nature Materials"],"m_BiGrams":["fuel cell","catalytic activity","cell catalyst","pure platinum","efficiency platinum","platinum fuel","platinum atom"],"m_TriGrams":["fuel cell catalyst","platinum fuel cell"],"m_SocialTags":[],"m_Topics":[],"m_Industry":[],"m_Technology":[],"m_BiCnt":[12,5,5,4,3,3,3],"m_TriCnt":[5,3],"m_iDocBodyWordCnt":464}
