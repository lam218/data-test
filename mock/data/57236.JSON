My involvement in the student project space at MIT ultimately spurred me to become a mentor for students building their own projects of all types. Interestingly, the most valuable advice I often gave was not how to make things, but where to get things. A small “hub motor” scooter I built in 2008 that I used as transport for 2 years. In my years of building vehicles (and robots), I had unknowingly amassed a huge repository of places to buy or scrounge parts,","m_szDocBody":"viber freshman year mit building small electric vehicle
