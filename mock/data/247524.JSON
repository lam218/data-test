NRG4All What worries me is the current spate of Petroleum Institute placing ads on TV exhorting people to “Vote for Energy”, meaning oil and gas.  And of course not a word about the greenhouse effect that consumption entails.  I suspect the timing is coordinated to offset the press coverage that the COP21 is getting.  I wish that the renewable industry would counter with some ads explaining the effect of that fossil fuel burning and exhort people to “Vote for Renewables”.  But, their resources are like a flea in an elephants back in comparison. http://zacharyshahan.com/ Zachary Shahan L","m_szDocBody":"maybe nrgall worry current spate petroleum institute placing ads
