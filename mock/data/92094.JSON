The new film — created by researchers at UC Irvine — can also aid in the main tangency of a clean surface, as it can also keep grime in raindrops and other moisture from sticking. Moth eyeballs are made up of tiny cones that reduce glare. UC Irvine researchers copied the pattern on a new, flexible material and c","m_szDocBody":"moth eyeball inspire glaredimming goldcoating solar panel jame ayre glare commonly object solar panel electronic display greatly reduced newly developed transparent film black inspired moth eyeball film created researcher irvine aid main tangency clean surface grime raindrop moisture sticking moth eyeball made tiny cone reduce glare irvine researcher copied pattern new flexible material coated bit gold make product improve solar panel led display disguising weapon image credit george hodan found simple process tiny bit gold turn transparent film black stated irvine chemistry professor robert corn lead researcher created patterned polymer material based finding humorously discovered practically accident researcher worried initially noticed appeared soot flexible film designing coat product university california irvine more painstaking test though researcher realised theyd accidentally discovered fabricate surface capable eliminating glare etched repeating pattern cone modelled moth eyeball nanoscale teflon nonstick surface applied thin layer gold cone and voila shine gold light reflecting obliterated material highly hydrophobic meaning repel liquid angry resident newport beach california city england australia complained vociferously neighbour installing highly reflective solar panel unintentionally beam blinding sunlight property addition troop risk enemy detection sunshine bounce weaponry cellphone display unreadable bright light coating solve issue irvine office technology alliance filed patent application work excited technology lead interested exploring commercial opportunity advancement present stated senior licencing officer doug crawford finding detailed paper published nano letter acs applied material interface cleantechnicas completely free electric car report electric car early adopter follower date hottest cleantech new subscribing free cleantech newsletter eye sectorspecific new also free solar energy newsletter electric vehicle newsletter wind energy newsletter ","m_szGeo1":"United States","m_szSourceType":"source_news","m_szSrcUrl":"http://cleantechnica.com/2014/04/08/moth-eyeballs-inspire-glare-dimming-gold-coating-solar-panels/","m_Places":["Irvine — Can","Irvine","Newport","California","England","Australia"],"m_People":["James Ayre","Tiny Cones","George Hodan","Doug Crawford"],"m_Companies":["Moth","Uc","University Of California","Alliances","Acs","Applied Materials"],"m_BiGrams":["moth eyeball","solar panel"],"m_TriGrams":[],"m_SocialTags":[],"m_Topics":[],"m_Industry":[],"m_Technology":[],"m_BiCnt":[4,4],"m_TriCnt":[],"m_iDocBodyWordCnt":257}
