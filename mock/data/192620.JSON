application claim benefit priority great britain application filed jan entire disclosure incorporated reference field invention invention relate vehicle body panel particularly exclusively motor bonnet assembly vehicle agricultural vehicle tractor equipped perforated grid air intake cooling system background bonnet serve multiple purpose modem vehicle all nonperforated part bonnet separate engine bay environment avoid unwanted dust debris entering guide air inside engine bay grid therefore bonnet partly sealed surrounding part vehicle chassis area air entry grid cooling package force entering air pass grid filtering reason cooling system perforated grid integrated bonnet provide air intake heat exchanger serve sieve retain debris exceeding size soiling heat exchanger cooling system result decreased cooling performance damage cooling fan addition this styling requirement concerned design motor bonnet major impact styling vehicle tractor concerned affix perforated grid bonnet grid made flat steel plate closely positioned aperture stamped aperture holohedral form round hexagonal shape diameter distance apart afterward plane grid cut required outer shape pressed deepdrawn obtain threedimensional shape needed stiffness installation due fact aperture holohedral outer geometry cut threedimensional forming process edge grid shaped easily injure operator outer geometry corrugated negative styling point view corrugation caused varying flow characteristic material deformation alternative perforation holohedral providing unperforated area outer periphery grid require aperture flat steel plate stamped manner dependent required shape grind expensive produce reduce intake surface prevent corrugation edge alternative outer shape finished forming grid require additional cycle production increasing cost alternative grid covered rubber material require thicker coating reduce size aperture weaken structure aperture increased size offset thicker coating rubber coating expensive thin galvanic powder coating dip coating corrosion protection due this grid assembled side bonnet cover sharp corrugated edge grid type assembly prohibited shape mating contour example receiving part ushaped limb reducing distance end therefore complex threedimensional forming inserted part positioned inside damaging painting assembly grid bonnet additional aspect considered stamping procedure produce aperture rim extending grid surface combination sharp edge outer shape grid increase danger painting part receive grid damaged contacted grid good contact provided lower stiffness grid movement relative stiffer receiving part due vibration type damage avoided screwing part contact areas circumferential screwing increase assembly effort increase requirement shape position tolerance increasing manufacturing cost overcome problem grid positioned receiving part adhesive sealing mean applied manually carefully hardened assembly increasing assembly time general overlapping contour reduce perforated surface grid reducing air intake surface air intake capacity reduced higher air speed accepted increasing pressure drop debris suction summary object invention
