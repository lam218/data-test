March 9th, 2015 by John Farrell   While local renewable energy and energy efficiency are both proving to be near-existential threats to electric utilities in the early 21st century, the trends aren’t the same. The rapid rise of renewable energy gets the headlines, and it’s big news. Total renewable energy capacity has grown 10-fold since 2003 and in certain parts of the country, wind and solar represent more than 20% of electricity on the grid. But while renewable energy leads in the news, energy efficiency may be the more persisten","m_szDocBody":"energy efficiency persistent threat utility john farrell local renewable energy energy
