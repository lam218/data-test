The ABS fiber-reinforced chair took about two hours to print out on a machine developed by the Dept. of Energyâ€™s Oak Ridge National Lab and machine tool maker Cincinnati Inc. in Harrison, Ohio. The giant 3D printer is based on a Cincinnati Inc. laser cutter. It moves the print head at about 12k in./sec. when it prints polymer parts, say Cincinnati personnel, and is expected to become commercially available by the end of the year.
