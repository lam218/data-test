competitive freight and franchising markets, a huge increase in passenger journeys and freight carried, and increasing industry efficiency is transforming the finances of the railway. • The passenger network now generates enough income (£9bn) to cover its day-to-day operating costs, while government support (£4bn) is helping to build a bigger, better railway through Network Rail. • The amount of money returning to government from passenger operations has risen by £1.56bn since 1997","m_szDocBody":"rail dataset financial operational performance summary combination highly competitive freight
