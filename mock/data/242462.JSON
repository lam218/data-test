Stanford engineers did just that. They have provided design principles to build energy efficient, corrosion-protected solar cells. The impacts of this research are far-reaching for the solar industry and the battle against climate change. Importantly, writes Stanford reporter Ramin Skibba , this process might be a huge leap in remaking greenhouse gases into something good. “I","m_szDocBody":"stanford design underwater solar cell
