April 16th, 2015 by James Ayre   Are electric vehicles the best choice for teenage drivers (assuming that upfront costs aren’t an issue)? That’s an interesting question, one where I’d have to lean towards saying yes… with caveats, that is. I’d argue that the main reasons supporting this position are the limited single-charge driving ranges (making it harder for the kid to just drive off somewhere on an unannounced holiday); the reduced operating/fuel costs (most of us remember gas money being a limiting factor in traveling, I assume); ","m_szDocBody":"electric vehicle choice teenage driver jame ayre electric vehicle choice teenage
