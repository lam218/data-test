roundtrip efficiency deal killer hope improve generate lot heat tolerate heat electricity peak then sell break losse add cost finance charge salary depreciation bobwallace zinc air inc zai month technology commercial project zai pipeline million sale weve grid storage battery technology claiming commercial level production year two affordable price storage arctic ocean icefree year immense move renewable generation affordable otis affordable scalable storage technology matter time here conventional generation waste lot energy sake grid stabilisation producing ramp fast enough additionally fluctuation day inefficiency thermal plant scaling daily with exception designed peaker plant expensive additional stresse put thermal plant constant cycling company add storage simply plant run constant level ramping slowly often increasing generation efficiency extending plant life minimising repair cost but storage there make economic sense storage primarily cheaper renewable generation demand responsive scale plant anyway economical make battery backup thermal plant originally economical make battery backup thermal plant since original backup economically renewable add overhead renewable use renewable line storage cycle repeat eventually thermal plant forced economic prerequisite battery cheap economical scaling thermal power plant game over bobwallace good point battery storage fossil fuel plant run effective speed ramping down adam grant business decision maker arent concerned arctic environment general fossil fuel industry slowed pace regulation ultimately rising cost fossil fuel tip balance outlook bright reasonable cost oil rise significantly country year depend import rising cost oil increase cost coal gas extraction significantly coal bulky travel pipeline moved internal combustion engine current overcapacity solar cell producer prove good business case renewable clearer suddenly instal panel bobwallace suspecting arctic melt big impact fossil fuel industry act expect greatly ramp public opinion greenhouse gas problem cost decrease coal fair amount discussion company coal resource sell product shut coal use weve reached point coal producer route product west coast order ship excess china dont increase oil price year people predicting sudden shortfall peak theyve making prediction year short year battery give range drive day couple

year forward hearing sinciron hmm sinc one zachary shahan thank snipped yesterday slight misquote jmin post zach zinc air inc good jub keeping wrap hereas redox flow battery sysrem compare efficienct flouride shuttle process developed couple year ago well zachary shahan yeah surprised hadnt heard noted keeping low ross cost compare surplus renewable energy powertogas based sabatier reaction ronald brakel well dont cost system yet energy efficient producing methane gas sabatier reaction surprised flow battery dont turn cheaper meeting electricity demand hour concerned ross yes surprised certainty lenz stated powertogas dominant storage technology germany otis agreed system hour regular cycle bit buffer fulfilled battery excess make methane long term storage current battery arent suitable heavy construction charging infrastructure airline offgrid backup longhaul trucking type situation russell scenario doesnt country seasonable storage renewable process turn electricity usable hydrocarbon handy expect battery hour impossible seasonal course bobwallace reason seasonal storage wind data budischak paper page youll renewable produce electricity season exception hold back hydro spring summer demand low wind supply high russell solar wipe floor term cost production capacity technology continue exponential cost decrease cheapest form electricity far place sun winter renewable capable delivering people cost option kind solar cell connected store cheap electricity seasonally rooftop solar panel supplied year kind seasonal storage completely offgrid bonus part world grid isnt reliable simply all happen developed country grid death spiral scenario utility make money back expensive winter electricity flat connexion fee happening place aus utilitiy say grid month winter pay year stay connected grid matter dont sell month connexion bobwallace battery cost money hydrogen tank cost money cost storing power month extremely high ready purchase set leadacid battery hold day worth electricity electricity day most battery cost week worth electricity storage people easily cost month worth cost realistically aus utility company entitled level compensation provide time wont unreasonably overcharge worst case totally control government crack down russell agree scenario talking speculative number optimum scenario rational power company happen certainty part world specifically talking potential tech convert electricity hydrocarbon hydrogen wouldnt cost price store gas tank month dont cost hydrogen perhap fully agree month battery storage cost much that electricity great benefit place cheaper building power line place road power line truck delivering cheap clean hydrocarbon made renewable electricity cheaper building power line environmentally friendly more take metal build power line pete stile bob battery getting invested trojan res total theoretical capacity kwh cycle wouldnt push past cycle recharge pete stile practise reduce consumption poor sun day battery cycle problem bobwallace shopping res youve good source share dont pull night seldom push sunless day gen happen night two pete stile unbeatable price paying core
