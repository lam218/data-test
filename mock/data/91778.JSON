Photo: Toyota Motor. Over the past few years, battery electric vehicles, or BEVs, such as Tesla Motors' Model S, have gained significant popularity. Unfortunately, they still exhibit a number of problems, including limited range -- although that's not as much of an issue with the Model S -- and long charge times.
