OVERVIEW: Critical metals are high-value elements used in very small amounts that provide key functionality to technology products. These metals are crucial for the functioning of a technological society. Certainty of supply is a growing concern. As of this writing, China produces over 95 percent of the world ' s rare earths and over ","m_szDocBody":"dealing shortage critical material research technology management mehlman stewart mehlman
