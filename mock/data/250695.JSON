Nissan is planning to add an electric vehicle with a range extender sometime in the future, according to recent reports. The deputy general manager of electric car engineering at Nissan, Yoshi Shimoida, commented recently to Motoring that, “In the future, Nissan will add to the lineup of EV (electric vehicle) systems an engine that is only for generating energy.” The LEAF, though, won’t be getting a range extender engine — it’ll reportedly be an entirely new design, with a completely different chassis
