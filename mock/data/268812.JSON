Originally published on EV Obsession . The Tesla Model S looks to be on track to match (at the least) the battery longevity performance of the Roadster, based on a recent survey of 80 European Model S owners. While you might be saying, “well, 80 owners isn’t much of a data pool,” it’s all that we’ve got to go on for now — and it is promising. Altogether, on average, the data show that Model S batteries have only degraded by around 5% after ~30,000 miles (50,000 kilometers). Interestingly, battery capacity loss seems to leve","m_szDocBody":"battery degradation level tesla model mile originally published obsession tesla model track match least battery longevity performance
