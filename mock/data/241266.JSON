The odd thing is that there are people who apparently know nothing about it but decide it’s their duty to tell people the energy payback of solar panels is a decade or more (which it is not!). One of my solar stories recently got tweeted by Elon Musk , then subsequently submitted to a popular subreddit, then (of course) pounced on by loud nuclear fanatics (story all about that coming).
