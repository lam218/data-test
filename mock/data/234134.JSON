(Graph) Reposted from RenewEconomy : Today’s Graph of the Day is a simple one, and is designed to dispel the myth about energy pay-back times, at least for solar PV. Some anti-renewable commentators and myth-makers would have us believe that solar PV modules do not pay back the energy used to create it. It’s not true. This graph of the day was presented by Muriel Watt, the chair of the APVA, at a seminar on Community Power in Sydney that I chaired on Wednesday. It’s not a new graph, but demonstrates that the payback is actually very quick.
