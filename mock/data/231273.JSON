Tesla’s Chief Technology Officer, JB Straubel, recently revealed that the Model 3 will make use of mostly new technology — rather than simply reusing many of the technologies used in the Model S sedan and the Model X SUV. The interesting comments came during a recent presentation (October 11th) at the University of Nevada – Reno — where he stated that new motor technology would be used, as well as new battery technology, etc. (Thanks to “aronth5” on the Tesla Motors Club forum for this.)","m_szDocBody":"tesla model technology straubel presentation originally published obsession teslas chief technology officer straubel recently revealed model make technology simply reusing technology model sedan model suv interesting comment recent presentation october university nevada reno stated motor technology used battery technology etc thank aronth tesla motor club forum this transcription comment question provided for wanting watch video audubonb forum inventing platform battery architecture motor technology brand vehicle structureso lot work started year ago brand vehicle basic tesla interface reused change functional technology wrong trim manufacturing cost order meet pricing goal set company exec move make lot sense profitably sell model price told retail for final note here tonybelding caught humorous line straubel model sport utility vehicle weve built platform model quickly quickly huh gonna complain here quality standard company hold good thing wonder model development regard model deadline cleantechnicas completely free electric car report electric car early adopter follower want youd attend electric vehicle solar power event conducted cleantechnica date hottest cleantech new subscribing free cleantech newsletter eye sectorspecific new also free solar energy newsletter electric vehicle newsletter wind energy newsletter tag straubel tesla tesla model tesla model jame ayre background predominantly geopolitic history obsessive interest pretty everything early life spent imperial free city dortmund jame river ruhr cofbuokheim attended university astnide briefly considered entering coal mining business write living broad variety subject ranging science politic military history renewable energy follow work google related post mandate carbon taxe teslas quarterly conference call cleantech talk leigh skilling hoping model glad hear progress marching start min info model shane pricing functionality release year aspiration idea close tesla them theyll overshoot car arrive year mile range brook bridge plan buy youre taking bet number bobwallace let date clear lecture understand tesla good source nice edited version wouldnt long watch brook bridge tesla from going seen video wont bored elon showman straubel isnt hes direct plain spoken passion hes clearly frank found interesting didnt run gas line figured out reexamination construction interesting solution put place brook bridge yes purposefully put nogas box for giga factory theyd forced solution kind forward thinking blow mind kyle field great talk surprised building ground scratch cost effective reuse hey expert shiggity reuse creating supply chain nothing supply chain evs car maker make talk tesla motor part sourcing elon master sourcing part creating supply chain creating supply chain rocket company ground harder share component company people forget spacex vertically integrated frank bet reusing engineer battery expensive efficient design important car smaller expensive design criteria different and elon cool different designed dream car stupid havent yet ","m_szGeo1":"United States","m_szSourceType":"source_industry","m_szSrcUrl":"http://cleantechnica.com/2015/11/01/tesla-model-3-to-be-mostly-new-technology-jb-straubel-presentation/","m_Places":["Tesla","Reno","Free City","Dortmund","Brooks"],"m_People":["Jb Straubel","James Ayre","Leigh Skilling"],"m_Companies":["University Of Nevada","Cleantech","University Of Astnide","Google","Tesla Motors","Spacex"],"m_BiGrams":["supply chain","brook bridge","creating supply"],"m_TriGrams":["creating supply chain"],"m_SocialTags":[],"m_Topics":[],"m_Industry":[],"m_Technology":[],"m_BiCnt":[4,3,3],"m_TriCnt":[3],"m_iDocBodyWordCnt":424}
