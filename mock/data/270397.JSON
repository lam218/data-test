The new robot-fish is under development by an interdisciplinary team of scientists from the applied technology institute NYU-Poly in New York City. Plenty of other robotic fish in the sea The new mechanical fish adds an interactive twist to a growing list of small aquatic robots under development. Until now, these devices, such as a jellyfish-lik","m_szDocBody":"tina casey boy scout helping apocryphal lady cross street inspiration kind rescue robot guide fish oil spill aquatic hazard robotfish development interdisciplinary team scientist applied technology institute nyupoly york city plenty robotic fish sea mechanical fish add interactive twist growing list small aquatic robot development now device jellyfishlike robot aptly named robojelly robotic bubble fishshaped device recently deployed spain generally designed call behaviour live sea creature primary function underwater exploration surveillance environmental monitoring resemblance fish aquatic life any derive design requirement related durability agility propulsion biomimicry interactive robotic fish nyupoly robot take biomimicry angle level attracting live fish stimulating follow lead latest study research team designed oversized zebrafish inches length compared inch typical adult zebrafish painted robot lengthwise stripe give zebrafish name guarantee attractiveness gave proportion mimic comehither fertile female zebra fish appealing gender experiment revealed though colour cue sexual availability variable influence behaviour live fish earlier experiment shown live fish follow robot based simply motion tail create attractive wake eliminate variable set experiment team segregated robotic fish compartment result fairly straightforward separated barrier live zebrafish preferred swim robot disperse part tank indicating respond visual cue creation wake secondbest proved substitute real thing though new live zebrafish introduced compartment tank zebrafish quickly deserted robot flesh blood rival sound proved factor darkened tank noise robot motor disagreed live fish snoring partner make disagreeable bed decamped empty compartment which apparently stood living room couch step robotic zebra fish maurizio porfiri associate professor nyupoly department mechanical aerospace engineering noise motor significant design obstacle developing silent mean propulsion priority project move forward development early version robot lack autonomous behaviour capability rapidly developed advanced robotic autonomous behaviour important rescue robot deployed environment human navigate survive example navy developing firefighting humanoid robot respond hand signal cue live person direction general area fire robot act autonomously draw closer source deploy firesuppressing agent porfiri future version robotic fish include sensory interface artificial intelligence order provide autonomous interaction robot live charge endowed artificial intelligence fish adapted foruse related field advanced robotic swarm small device designed coordinate behaviour autonomously result study academic bioinspiration biomimetic zebrafish response robotic fish preference experiment isolated individual small shoal image courtesy nyupoly follow twitter cleantechnicas completely free electric car report electric car early adopter follower want youd attend electric vehicle solar power event conducted cleantechnica date hottest cleantech new subscribing free cleantech newsletter eye sectorspecific new also free solar energy newsletter electric vehicle newsletter wind energy newsletter ","m_szGeo1":"United States","m_szSourceType":"source_industry","m_szSrcUrl":"http://cleantechnica.com/2012/06/12/new-swimming-robot-from-nyu-poly-mimics-a-zebra-fish/","m_Places":["New York City","Spain","Shoals"],"m_People":["Tina Casey","Maurizio Porfiri"],"m_Companies":["Boy Scouts","Institute Nyu","Jellyfish","Nyu","Poly Department Of Mechanical","Navy","Twitter"],"m_BiGrams":["robotic fish","live fish"],"m_TriGrams":[],"m_SocialTags":[],"m_Topics":[],"m_Industry":[],"m_Technology":[],"m_BiCnt":[],"m_TriCnt":[],"m_iDocBodyWordCnt":402}
