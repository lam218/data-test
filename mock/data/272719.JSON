population growth due people living longer peak emission peak child mean quit making problem worse continuing grow input now children lower emission rate zero quicka betta secondary school trick daniel laliberte reduce population fewer children this imposed child family entire world population rise year year population drop billion year long wait cut footprint half cutting population half that reason population growing children everyone poorest fewer children surviving population growing children grow live longer parent bobwallace reducing population level country fewer children japan example shrinking population country fertility rate lower needed replace population some holding due immigration attribute country higher fertility rate globally fertility rate slowing slowing slowly choice world population soar billion peak start falling lower fertility rate country fertility highest bring peak earlier lower number stress resource engage active lifeshortening strategy support option daniel laliberte death rate decline fertility rate typically decline later demographic lag population growth birth death balance again decrease lag further children already born grow children population still grow meanwhile reduce footprint focusing population missed entire environmental problem caused small fraction population eliminate reduce nonsustainable practise convert renewable energy recycling faster reduce population significant amount bobwallace suggest working problem dealing population growth dont set straw man generation children growing age fruitfulness children make economic poorest live end generation children stand good chance dropping birthrate significantly generation daniel laliberte point people focusing population deserve harder take longer reducing environmental footprint half reducing population half sound reducing population easier turn harder take longer extreme example suddenly children starting now worldwide average lifespan year year half population alive longer reproduce extreme example eliminate close fossil fuel burning year faster wanted eliminating largest contributor environmental footprint population are growth already slowing year place growing place footprint can lot significantly reduce footprint quickly anyway bobwallace suspect stop population growth year lower peak projected essentially stop fossil fuel sooner both simultaneously slowing population growth peaking sooner make easier move fossil fuel daniel laliberte agree here emphasis population slow population growth faster are try wont make difference eliminating fossil fuel burning entirely analogous eliminating entire population equate population footprint completely contrary difficult people imagine way grow food way improve environment food grow avoid creating pollution assume side effect industrial civilization save money process time renewable energy energy use reduce ecological footprint close average decade work lot extra work clean huge mess created couple century mean negative footprint average then here mind blower multiplying negative average footprint people make total negative people part solution problem daniel laliberte negate unsustainable part growth growth equally economic activity clean environment contribute gdp daniel laliberte agree negative growth negative growth nonsustainable part economy enormous positive growth sustainable part based renewable energy recycling sustainable agriculture etc reduce footprint developed world time close helping developing world stay close footprint already developed people continue focus population essentially defending status quo exploitation world wealthiest fraction world dont understand reduce environmental footprint close zero clean restore century environmental destruction crossing negative footprint territory bobwallace slow reverse population growth larger grow population renewable energy sustainable produce population size control limiting climate change
