Their question was: how low does the production cost of electricity really need to be? I gave them this two-fold answer: 1. We are hitting something similar to 'Peak Oil' right now. The symptoms are the opposite of ","m_szDocBody":"peak oil now lowcost energy fix tuesday comment gail tverberg follow follow past week gave presentation interested type renewable energysolar energy deployed space provide electricity hour day question was low production cost electricity gave twofold answer hitting similar peak oil now symptom opposite people expected glut supply price cost
