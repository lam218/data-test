Opponents of the plan, including the more than two dozens states that have filed suit to stop it, insist that the regulatory package aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions 32% by 2030 will bankrupt their states — imposing higher electricity costs on their residents as utilities struggle to comply.","m_szDocBody":"press release decarbonize energy system chart powerful modelling tool lay
