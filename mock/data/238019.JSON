RobMF We’ve already locked in some consequences from global warming. But victory might just be soon enough for an effective response to what’s coming and a prevention of even worse outcomes than we see now. In the end, though, a renewables based economy would be far fairer and far more prosperous than the one we have now. If there is a path to future prosperity, it is through an energy switch. Calamity_Jean You’re right that a renewables economy would be a vast improvement over the current one.

drilling technique failure rate remain high research money isnt forthcoming geothermal risky business uncleb iceland larmion exceptional geothermal resource essentially perpetually gently erupting volcano temperature close surface good country challenging geology easy access geothermal account electricity production though heating and rising hydro cheaper mike shurtleff larmion great answer geothermal wind linear growth recently siting geography reason started compete source grid solar exponential growth cost falling fastest all day place poor alternative grid electricity cost importantly endofgrid cost advantage greatest advent low cost battery storage solar compete grid electricity head hour power generation day year place solar storage dominate neroden yep hydro remain

happening fast avoid dangerous climate change sincerely michael taylor irena larmion interesting actual cost variance graph big hydro onshore wind remarkably low variance cost highly predictable largely similar study area solar hand incredibly variance lot solar built areas ill suited result poor policy excessive subsidy overly strict domestic requirement clear renewable source bigger better biggest project tend cluster lower cost range smaller overrepresented expensive outlier biomass insensitive scale small installation cut cost local fuel waste expensive wood brought afar important
