The Volt emits significantly less smog-forming pollution than other PHEVs, according to a GM study presented to the Society of Automotive Engineers. Furthermore, GM-Volt reports that the engineering analysis for the new 2016 Volt that will be on the market soon shows Chevrolet’s new Volt will outperform the 2011–2014 specification Volts studied.
