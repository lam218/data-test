If you’ve obsessively been following Tesla for long, there’s a decent chance you’ve already run across this. But a few things this week reminded me that the majority of the population, and probably even the majority of EV drivers and enthusiasts, have never heard of Tesla’s “Secret Master Plan.” I think it’s a very important thing to know about and understand, so I’m revisiting it here in order to give more people a more complete picture of Tesla and what it is focused on achieving. (Full disclosure: I’m an investor","m_szDocBody":"secret tesla master plan coming life originally published obsession youve obsessively tesla long decent chance youve run this week reminded majority
