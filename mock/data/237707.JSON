Two new studies have linked fracking-related operations to earthquakes in Texas and Ohio, and a recently settled lawsuit in Arkansas indicates that swarms of tiny earthquakes can damage surface structures. Add earthquakes to a list that already includes water contamination and air pollution risks, and it becomes clear that a more effective regulatory platform is needed to protect existing communities from the impacts","m_szDocBody":"fracking headaches earthquake evidence grow tina casey trouble looming ahead community host fracking operation study linked frackingrelated operation earthquake texas
