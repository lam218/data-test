Adv. Mater. Advertisement A new lithium-ion battery is one of the smallest ever made and the first battery to be created with a three-dimensional printer. Measuring less than a millimeter on each side, it fits comfortably on the head of pin and could potentially power tiny medical devices or miniature robots. 3D printers make objects from the ground up by depositing successive layers of material on top of each other.
