All self driving cars have one thing in common — a combination of radars, cameras, ultrasonic sensors and GPS receivers that tell them where they are and how to proceed to their destination. They also rely to some extent on digital maps to help them find their way. Google and Apple both have invested a lot of time and money on fleets of cars that drive around, collecting data. As usual, Tesla has a better idea and it’s brilliant.
