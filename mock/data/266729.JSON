By Joseph Nagle, EverCharge Diesel is dying. Not a slow death, but an immediate one. Diesel was already on the ropes with the advent of powerful electric vehicles, but now with the Volkswagen scandal it all but seals its fate. It’s not diesel’s fault; it’s a cleaner-burning fuel than people realize, capable of powering incredibly large, powerful vehicles. There was only one major downside: pollution. While diesel burns cleaner, it still produces carcinogens, soot and nitrous oxide, which can be just as harmful to","m_szDocBody":"dieselgate good volkswagen originally published obsession joseph
