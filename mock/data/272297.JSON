In an interview with AutoExpress , though, Elon Musk revealed that a 500-mile battery will be possible “soon” … but at an exceedingly high cost. When asked “How far will a battery-powered car be able to go?,” Musk had this to say: It will be possible to have a 500-mile range car. In fact we could do it quite soon, but it would increase the price. Over time you could expect to have that kind of range.","m_szDocBody":"elon musk mile happen originally published gas eparated range mile charge tesla model longestrange electric car buy today
