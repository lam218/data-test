science is rapidly transforming the way that everything from cars to light bulbs is made, says Paul Markillie “I DO not depend on figures at all,” said Thomas Edison. “I try an experiment and reason out the result, somehow, by methods which I could not explain.” And so it was that by testing 1,600 different materials, from coconut fibre to fishing line and even a hair from a colleague’s beard, Edison finally found a particular type of bamboo which could be used, in carbonised form, as the filament in the first p","m_szDocBody":"technology quarterly material manufacturing material difference
