The U.S. Department of Energy has approved the final environmental impact statement for the 336-mile, 1000-megawatt  Champlain Hudson Power Express transmission line across the U.S.-Canada border near Champlain, New York, extending to New York City. The high-voltage direct current line, mostly underwater, will use Canada hydro to shave 2-3% off New York City’s power bills and provide needed
