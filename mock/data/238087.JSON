Households in Australia installed a rooftop solar system every 2.8 minutes in 2014 – almost the same rate as in the US , with barely 1/15 of the population. According to data compiled by Green Energy Markets , and based around the issue of renewable energy certificates, a total of 185,890 solar systems were installed in Australia in 2014 – almost all of them on household rooftops. That made for a total of 816MW.
