They have a horrible failure rate. I mean EV startups. Jacob Not really. LiFePo4 seems to be a cheaper choice for grid storage than the cell chemistry that Tesla use in their Powerwall. And not all vehicles need the insane acceleration that the Model S provides. Tractors and bulldozers for example could use LiFePo4 chemistry to cut diesel use.
