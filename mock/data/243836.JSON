It’s also an indication that some solar PV module prices are artificially high, and therefore there is some reason to believe they could decrease. Prices in the US for Tier 1 modules made in China were higher than in any other market. The price has been inflated by the trade tensions linked to modules produced in Taiwan and C","m_szDocBody":"solar module price vary region jake richardson new gtm research solar module price vary
