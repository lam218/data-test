High oil prices, growing concerns over energy security, and the threat of climate change have all stimulated investment in the development of alternatives to conventional oil. In this post (which is an excerpted chapter from The Post Carbon Reader: Managing the 21st Centuryâ€™s Sustainability Crises edited by Richard Heinberg and Daniel Lerch), I give an overview of some of
