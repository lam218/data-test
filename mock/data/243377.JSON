A couple of GM plug-in car enthusiasts over on GM-Volt have test driven the Cadillac ELR (a plug-in hybrid electric car that comes with a lot of luxury and a hefty price tag). Kindly (and I’m sure enthusiastically), they have shared their own reviews of the Cadillac ELR over on the GM-Volt forum. I’m reposting them both below for more curious eyes (images added).
