How would that change the future of electric vehicles? Just last week, we reported on a conversation with   Mitsuhisa Kato , Toyota’s head of research and development, who complains that the batteries available today are simply not good enough to make EV’s a credible choice for most buyers. Kato said it will take a “Nobel Prize winning battery” before EV’s go mainstream.

ball rolling show people hand experience adapt need lance pickup gas powered car range mile refuel gas powered car require special trip gas station people dont feel making trip often hand charged full night beit doesnt dont charge home minimal effort really range day people mean mile doubling account unexpected trip occasional day extra range mile again people everyone mile range extreme overkill agree statement people shown need doesnt imply urban commuter vehicle mile range work perfectly fine typical suburban situation family gas vehicle long trip dont call car eitherthe daily driver
