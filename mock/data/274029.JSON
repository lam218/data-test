It was an interesting experience. The Nissan LEAF Is A Winner My little sister, Mira, in front of three Nissan LEAFs. One of them is now a CleanTechnica LEAF. The LEAF really impressed me. It is a really nice car, imho.

nissan leaf for time bmw for secondtime week florida interesting experience nissan leaf winner sister mira front nissan leaf cleantechnica leaf leaf impressed nice car imho leaf significant improvement leaf memory realised real situation was drove bmw drove nissan leaf bmw pretty wicked acceleration cuttingedge lookatme style good impression leaf nicer drive higherpriced mercede bmw gasmobile perception warped test drive didnt have leaf drove cynthia and reviewing smooth drive cynthia noticed itfelt smoother thanevery electric car test drove model bmw porsche panamera ehybrid chevy volt something drove bmw cadillac elr cynthia leaf smoother expected nonerev phev assmooth asthe elr anyhow super smooth drive renting gasmobile noticeable appreciated acceleration doesnt compare higherend car mentioned course peppy enjoyable expect fully electric car volt impressed great licence plate biggest comparison volt afraid warped comparison test drive night sleep model panamera ehybrid driving wickedawesome car volt didnt feel special impression leaf acceleration better technically shouldnt afraid perception simplygot warped ill backtoback test drive point comparison nonetheless feeling arent electric drive solid one interior preferred leaf felt lot spaceand haveone seat volt windshield leaf favourite car big great visibility volt excel category volt person thought looked picture ive picture bit person still prefer leaf front totally subjective matter course lot extra gasoline range fine mile electric range volt hard beat price point competitive gasoline vehicle lacking joy convenience electric drive volt mile range acceleration hard car beat bmw top bmw clear leader groupbut price expect that noted above leaf smoother drivebut acceleration wicked acceleration fun strongest regenerative braking industry totally awesome accustomed bring car full stop city driving instance quickly car regenerative braking model great regen enjoyable onepedal driving bmw offer onepedal driving best downside space back doesnt match leaf again seater seater passenger back dont space assuming technically dont general sit bit higher like distance floor thespot butt doesnt far see cuttingedge hate love sister hated mom loved love feel bit errr depending day angle backdoor opened apparently unusual opinion stand point locking yearold back
