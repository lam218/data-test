One clever and interesting comment from Ronald Brakels stood out to me, though, so I thought I’d highlight it on this lazy Saturday for a lot more people to enjoy and bookmark. Here it is (image added): By Ronald Brakels Amount of lithium required to drive a Leaf 200,000 kilometers (125,000 miles) = 4 kilograms.
