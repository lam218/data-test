But with just six refilling stations concentrated in SoCal, hydrogen fuel cell vehicles lack any sort of refueling infrastructure. So what does Hyundai want to do to change that? In an interview with Green Car Reports , Hyundai executive Dave Zuchowski said, “We believe the fuel companies that have been doing this for 100 years should invest in
