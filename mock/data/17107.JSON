We are in the initial stages of a paradigm shift to clean, inexpensive, abundant fuel and clean-fueled, highly efficient engines for automobiles, trucks and especially fleets that refuel at central locations such as taxi cabs.

united state reason methanol presently made natural gas united state greatest reserve existing supply natural gas world analyst project natural gas price united state remain level year number methanol facility built increase significantly methanol derived natural gas lawmaker congress understand opportunity presently sponsored bill studied committee methanol fuel united state methanol burn cleaner gasoline diesel reduce car emission significantly methanol roughly half energy gasoline compared volume versus costwise expensive gasoline compared unit energy basis fuel methanol effective octane rating octane premium gasoline versus octane methanol higher flame speed gasoline leading higher efficiency higher latent heat vaporisation time higher gasoline cooling engine fuel injection burn cleaner gasoline safer fuel gasoline case fire difficult ignite release heat burn methanol fire extinguished plain water current car blended gasoline diesel ediesel methanol produced source including natural gas landfill gas biogas coal produced renewable fuel farm waste wood chip suitable agricultural municipal waste material united state largest natural gas reserve world natural gas automobile
