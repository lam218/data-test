May 17th, 2012 by Joshua S Hill     The Sahara Desert may be a wonderful place to gather solar power, but it’s a lousy location to then transfer that power somewhere else. New research from engineers at the University of Strathclyde, Glasgow have decided to pursue an even more extreme place — they are promoting the idea of gathering solar energy from space. But it may actually improve accessibility. The university researchers have already tested equipment in space that would provide a platform for solar panels to collect energy and allow it to be transferred back to Eart","m_szDocBody":"solar power space joshua hill sahara desert wonderful place gather solar power lousy location transfer power else research engineer university strathclyde glasgow decided pursue extreme place promoting idea gathering solar energy space improve accessibility university researcher tested equipment space provide platform solar panel collect energy transferred back earth microwave laser development provide reliable power source world previously transferring solar power difficult terrain good generation solar energy necessarily habitable region moreover time natural disaster technology invaluable wake destroyed infrastructure massimiliano vasile model test satellite space fantastic source collecting solar power advantage gather time day weather condition massimiliano vasile university strathclyde department mechanical aerospace engineering leading space based solar power research areas sahara desert quality solar power captured difficult transport energy areas used however research focusing remove obstacle spacebased solar power target difficult reach areas microwave laser beam energy back earth directly specific areas provide reliable quality source energy remove storing energy coming renewable source ground provide constant delivery solar energy initially smaller satellite generate energy small village aim technology available day put large structure space gather energy capable powering large city team science engineering student strathclyde complete space web experiment launched edge space arctic circle experiment suaineadh twisting scot gaelic important step forward construction larger structure vasile added success suaineadh move forward stage project involve reflector needed collect solar power current project called sam selfinflating adaptable membrane test deployment ultra light cellular structure change shape deployed structure made cell selfinflating vacuum change volume independently nanopump structure replicate natural cellular structure exist living thing independent control cell morph structure solar concentrator collect sunlight project solar array structure build large space system assembling thousand small individual unit source university strathclyde glasgow cleantechnicas completely free electric car report electric car early adopter follower want youd attend electric vehicle solar power event conducted cleantechnica date hottest cleantech new subscribing free cleantech newsletter eye sectorspecific new also free solar energy newsletter electric vehicle newsletter wind energy newsletter ","m_szGeo1":"United States","m_szSourceType":"source_industry","m_szSrcUrl":"http://cleantechnica.com/2012/05/17/solar-power-in-space/","m_Places":["Glasgow"],"m_People":["Joshua S Hill","Massimiliano Vasile","Dr Massimiliano Vasile"],"m_Companies":["University Of Strathclyde","Indeed","Department Of Mechanical"],"m_BiGrams":["solar power","solar energy","university strathclyde"],"m_TriGrams":[],"m_SocialTags":[],"m_Topics":[],"m_Industry":[],"m_Technology":[],"m_BiCnt":[9,4,3],"m_TriCnt":[],"m_iDocBodyWordCnt":321}
