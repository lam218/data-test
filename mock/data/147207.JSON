ALBUQUERQUE, N.M.  You cant get something for nothing, physicists say, but sometimes a radical innovation can come close. Researchers at Sandia National Laboratories  exceeding the predictions of a 100-year-old law of physics  have shown that filaments fabricated of tungsten lattices  emit remarkably more energy than solid tungsten filaments in certain bands of near-infrared wavelengths when heated. This greater useful output offers the possibility of a superior ","m_szDocBody":"download dpi jpeg image shawnlinjpg media image related new storey albuquerque nothing physicist say radical innovation
