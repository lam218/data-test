Round trip efficiency, capital cost, maintenance cost, footprint, location constraints, reliability, system life and emissions are all considerations in procuring a storage system. CAES seems to score very high on these except for footprint because of the low energy density. Mark It’s good that storage is being developed.  I like wind and love solar, but have been accused of being a naysayer because I don’t see them truly overtaking fossil fuels until viable quantities of grid-scale storage can also be brought online.
