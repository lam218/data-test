December 6th, 2015 by Mike Barnard   The Tesla Model X is the first fully electric SUV in the world. It was announced with much fanfare — Bioweapon Defense Mode! Falcon-wing doors! Clown-car volumes of people and luggage coming out! — by Musk with a handful of lucky and rich people getting early editions and paying a big premium for the privilege. But something didn’t get as much attention. It’s the first fully electric sport utility in the world and this ‘offroad’ crossover category is a good lens to look at fuel efficiency for averag","m_szDocBody":"tesla model fuel efficiency mike
