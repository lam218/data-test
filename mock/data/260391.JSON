(CHART) | CleanTechnica","m_szYear":"2014","m_szDocSumamry":"What’s The Greenest Car When You Take Fuel Sources Into Account? (CHART) Originally published on Shrink That Footprint . By Lindsay Wilson A few months back I did a post called  The World’s 7 Greenest Vehicles . It only included one car. Since then a few readers have emailed to ask if I could do a similar comparison, but for cars only. So here’s a very brief guide to vehicle emissions. In the graph above I’ve compared the full vehicle emissions of four petrol cars (20, 30, 40 and 50 MPG) to that of an electric vehicle using four different types of electricity (coal, oil, gas and solar).
