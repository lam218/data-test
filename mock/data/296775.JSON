It will probably take at least three or four decades, and will fundamentally change the way we live. Nobody knows how to accomplish the transition in detail, because this has never been done before. Most previous energy transitions were driven by opportunity, not policy. And they were usually additive, with new energy resources piling onto old ones (we still use firewood, even though we","m_szDocBody":"infographic surprising way consume oil day transition entail
