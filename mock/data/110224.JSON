Water electrolysis is a better way to go but it isn't going to be emissions free either, yet it is getting a little closer.Â Researchers at Stanford University have developed a low-cost, emissions-free device that uses an ordinary AAA battery to produce hydrogen by sending an electric current through two electrode","m_szDocBody":"hydrogen fuel water ordinary aaa battery new staff year american consumer finally purchase fuel cell car zeroemission vehicle but current electric car really car run hydrogen made natural gas water electrolysis emission free either closerresearcher stanford university developed lowcost emissionsfree device ordinary aaa battery produce hydrogen sending electric current electrode split liquid water hydrogen oxygen gas unlike water splitter preciousmetal catalyst electrode stanford device made inexpensive abundant nickel iron stanford scientist developed lowcost device ordinary aaa battery split water oxygen hydrogen gas gas bubble produced electrode made inexpensive nickel iron credit mark precourt institut energy using nickel iron cheap material make electrocatalyst active split water room temperature single volt battery hongjie dai professor chemistry stanford this time nonprecious metal catalyst split water voltage low remarkable expensive metal platinum iridium achieve voltage addition producing hydrogen water splitter make chlorine gas sodium hydroxide important industrial chemical dai automaker long considered hydrogen fuel cell promising alternative gasoline engine fuel cell technology essentially water splitting reverse fuel cell combine stored hydrogen gas oxygen air produce electricity power car byproduct water unlike gasoline combustion emit carbon dioxide greenhouse gas earlier year hyundai began leasing fuel cell vehicle southern california toyota honda begin selling fuel cell car vehicle run fuel manufactured large industrial plant produce hydrogen combining hot steam natural gas energyintensive process release carbon dioxide byproduct splitting water make hydrogen require fossil fuel emit greenhouse gase scientist develop affordable active water splitter catalyst capable working industrial scale its constant pursuit decade make lowcost electrocatalyst activity long durability dai said when found nickelbased catalyst effective platinum complete surprise saving energy money discovery made stanford graduate student ming gong colead study ming discovered structure turn active pure nickel metal pure nickel oxide alone dai said this structure favour hydrogen electrocatalysis fully understand science catalyst significantly lower voltage required split water eventually save hydrogen producer billion dollar electricity cost gong goal improve durability device the electrode fairly stable slowly decay time said the current device run day week month preferable goal achievable based recent result researcher plan develop water splitter run electricity produced solar energy hydrogen ideal fuel powering vehicle building storing renewable energy grid dai were glad make catalyst active low cost show nanoscale engineering material make difference make fuel consume energy published nature communication ","m_szGeo1":"United States","m_szSourceType":"source_news","m_szSrcUrl":"http://www.science20.com/news_articles/hydrogen_fuel_from_water_using_an_ordinary_aaa_battery-143221","m_Places":["Dai","Southern California","Toyota","Most"],"m_People":["Mark Shwartz","Hongjie Dai"],"m_Companies":["Aaa","Stanford University","Volt","Hyundai","Honda"],"m_BiGrams":["fuel cell","water splitter","split water","ordinary aaa","aaa battery","nickel iron"],"m_TriGrams":["ordinary aaa battery"],"m_SocialTags":[],"m_Topics":[],"m_Industry":[],"m_Technology":[],"m_BiCnt":[],"m_TriCnt":[],"m_iDocBodyWordCnt":378}
