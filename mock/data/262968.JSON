That’s significant because the device is actually not a battery, it is a supercapacitor that can charge and discharge much faster than a battery. It’s also significant because the research team has devised a fabrication method that results in a long fiber (long as in 50 me","m_szDocBody":"graphene carbon nanotube supercapacitor rival lithium battery tina casey international team researcher recipe microscale flexible energy storage device made graphene carbon nanotube store energy rival gold standard lithium battery significant device battery supercapacitor charge discharge faster battery significant research team devised fabrication method result long fibre long metre long far open sort opportunity weaving supercapacitor clothing power portable electronic fibre double conductor place wire reduce size weight portable device including medical implant previous study supercapacitor published courtesy case western battery supercapacitor quick review battery supercapacitor store energy catch battery higher energy density mean store energy longer period low power density mean discharge quickly supercapacitor opposite problem low energy density mean store energy power density enable deliver energy rapidly needed trick solving energy density problem supercapacitor material proportion surface area energy storage graphene nanomaterial millennium material discovered year ago graphene consist sheet carbon atom thick twodimensional structure basically surface area notoriously finicky graphene present raft challenge translating power energy storage photovoltaic field taming graphene nanotube supercapacitor schematic work nanotube hybrid supercapacitor dingshang nanyang technological university singapore case western laming dai member current international research team china participating tsinghua university work tackled huge problem graphene effort shown hybrid approach promising graphene cooperating abovementioned technique for obtaining graphene film suffer lack film control leading loss surface area energy storage due graphene aggregation energy storage application therefore highly desirable onedimensional carbon nanotube cnt physically separate gns preserve graphene surface area study arrived selfassembly process solve problem resulting nanotube film hybrid supercapacitor fibre current study led yuan nayang technological university coauthored dai published nature nanotechnology detail team translated selfassembly technique long fibre solution acidoxidized singlewall nanotube graphene oxide ethylenediamine promote synthesis dope graphene nitrogen pumped flexible narrow reinforced tube called capillary column heated oven hour advantage structure enormous amount surface area energy storage charge conduction clocking whopping square metre gramme fibre favourable comparison lithium demonstrated solid state microsupercapacitor research team assembled nanotube fibre polyvinyl acid gel electrolyte device achieved density microwatt hour cubic millimetre research team compare microamperehour thin film lithium battery found interesting fibre arranged pair fibre arranged sery voltage tripled time stayed same however pair arranged parallel output current time tripled significant advantage cost supply chain issue compared lithium carbon nanotube graphene cheaper readily available lending assist favourable cost comparison hybrid supercapacitor appear longer lifecycle conventional rechargeable battery team tested supercapacitor cycle performance retention percent conventional rechargeable generally lose performance hit cycle mark cap off fibre retained performance subjected flexibility stress test stay tuned research team thinking ahead applying supercapacitor battery solar cell microbial fuel cell follow google latest clean tech new cleantechnica newsletter cleantechnicas completely free electric car report electric car early adopter follower want youd attend electric vehicle solar power event conducted cleantechnica date hottest cleantech new subscribing free cleantech newsletter eye sectorspecific new also free solar energy newsletter electric vehicle newsletter wind energy newsletter ","m_szGeo1":"United States","m_szSourceType":"source_industry","m_szSrcUrl":"http://cleantechnica.com/2014/05/12/new-graphene-carbon-nanotube-supercapacitor/","m_Places":["Nanyang","University","Singapore","Dai","China"],"m_People":["Tina Casey","Case Western","Dingshang Yu","Yuan Chen"],"m_Companies":["Tsinghua University","Cnts","Nayang Technological University And Co","Volt","Twitter","Google"],"m_BiGrams":["energy storage","research team","surface area","carbon nanotube","store energy","lithium battery","battery supercapacitor","energy density","density mean","area energy","hybrid supercapacitor"],"m_TriGrams":["surface area energy","area energy storage"],"m_SocialTags":[],"m_Topics":[],"m_Industry":[],"m_Technology":[],"m_BiCnt":[6,5,5,4,4,3,3,3,3,3,3],"m_TriCnt":[3,3],"m_iDocBodyWordCnt":474}
