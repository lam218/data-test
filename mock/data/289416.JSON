Scientists have developed a working laboratory demonstrator of a lithium-oxygen battery which has very high energy density, is more than 90% efficient, and, to date, can be recharged more than 2000 times, showing how several of the problems holding back the development of thes","m_szDocBody":"highly porous graphene electrode increase capacity lithiumoxygen battery demonstrator published written azonanooct researcher successfully demonstrated problem impeding practical development socalled ultimate battery overcome scientist developed working laboratory demonstrator lithiumoxygen battery energy density efficient and date recharged time showing problem holding back development device solved lithiumoxygen lithiumair battery touted ultimate battery due theoretical energy density time lithiumion battery energy density comparable gasoline enable electric car battery cost weight market drive london edinburgh single charge however case nextgeneration battery practical challenge addressed lithiumair battery viable alternative gasoline now researcher university cambridge demonstrated obstacle overcome developed labbased demonstrator lithiumoxygen battery higher capacity increased energy efficiency improved stability previous attempt demonstrator rely highly porous fluffy carbon electrode made graphene comprising oneatomthick sheet carbon atom additive alter chemical reaction work battery making stable efficient result reported science promising researcher caution practical lithiumair battery remain decade away weve achieved significant advance technology suggest areas research havent solved problem inherent chemistry result show route forward practical device professor clare grey cambridge department chemistry paper senior author technology day smaller faster cheaper year notable exception battery possibility smartphone last day needing charged challenge making battery holding back widespread adoption major clean technology electric car gridscale storage solar power simplest form battery made component positive electrode negative electrode electrolyte tao liu department chemistry paper author lithiumion liion battery laptop smartphone negative electrode made graphite form carbon positive electrode made metal oxide lithium cobalt oxide electrolyte lithium salt dissolved organic solvent action battery depend movement lithium ion electrode liion battery light capacity deteriorate age low energy density recharged frequently past decade researcher developing alternative liion battery lithiumair battery considered ultimate nextgeneration energy storage extremely energy density however previous attempt working demonstrator low efficiency poor rate performance unwanted chemical reaction cycled pure oxygen liu grey colleague developed chemistry earlier attempt nonaqueous lithiumair battery relying lithium hydroxide lioh lithium peroxide lio addition water lithium iodide mediator battery showed chemical reaction cell die making stable multiple charge discharge cycle precisely engineering structure electrode changing highly porous form graphene adding lithium iodide changing chemical makeup electrolyte researcher reduce voltage gap charge discharge volt small voltage gap equal efficient battery previous version lithiumair battery managed gap volt volt closer liion battery equate energy efficiency highly porous graphene electrode greatly increase capacity demonstrator rate charge discharge issue addressed include finding protect metal electrode doesnt form spindly lithium metal fibre dendrite battery explode grow shortcircuit battery additionally demonstrator cycled pure oxygen air carbon dioxide nitrogen moisture generally harmful metal electrode lot work liu weve suggest way solve problem weve differently plenty fundamental study remain done iron mechanistic detail current result extremely exciting development stage weve shown solution tough problem technology grey author acknowledge support department energy engineering physical science research council epsrc johnson matthey european union marie curie action graphene flagship technology patented commercialised cambridge enterprise university commercialisation arm ","m_szGeo1":"United States","m_szSourceType":"source_industry","m_szSrcUrl":"http://www.azonano.com/news.aspx?newsID=34095","m_Places":["London","Edinburgh","Cambridge","University"],"m_People":["Professor Clare Grey","Dr Tao Liu","Johnson Matthey"],"m_Companies":["University Of Cambridge","Department Of Chemistry","Gap","Volts","Us Department Of Energy","Engineering And Physical Sciences Research Council","Epsrc","European Union"],"m_BiGrams":["lithiumair battery","energy density","highly porous","liion battery","lithiumoxygen battery","electrode made","chemical reaction","charge discharge"],"m_TriGrams":[],"m_SocialTags":[],"m_Topics":[],"m_Industry":[],"m_Technology":[],"m_BiCnt":[6,5,4,4,3,3,3,3],"m_TriCnt":[],"m_iDocBodyWordCnt":472}
