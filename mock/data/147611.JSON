partnership to develop hydrogen fuel cell ferry and world’s largest refueling station LIVERMORE, Calif. — When it comes to environmental sustainability, Red and White Fleet president Tom Escher is all in. “Everyone is talking about reducing emissions by 20 percent, 40 percent or more,” he said. “I thought, ‘Why not do away with emissions altogether?’” Sandia National Laboratories and San Francisco’s Red and White Fleet are partnering to develop a high-speed, hydrogen-fuel-cell-powered passenger ferry and refueling station.  (Photo courtesy of Red an","m_szDocBody":"red white fleet
