zey limited mile hour case oestralin zey mile hour enjoy driving highway ivor oconnor lol vensonata yes mile range based hyper miling projection solid mile range condition expect however surprised end model kwh battery attain mile range air con mph battery cheaper lighter tesla bit time innovate gigafactory running bobwallace assume large capacity increase decade market set max range level people mile mph market decide lunch via recharging plenty karl brewer wouldnt max range determined speed charging charging availability fast charge ubiquitous charger big range thinking human shake bigger mentality steve grinwis well people pull trailer mountain winter theyll pay bigger pack also bigger pack higher performance due nature beast reason charger bigger pack bobwallace personally market settle mile range people pay lot range hard taxis average mile day charge driver meal break dont lot extra range long trip break hour current mod kwh battery kwh battery kwh perhap kwh more people night town richard foster bit range needed drive middle side lake district home where plethora charging point obvious reason mile round trip guess ill plan charging break route point doable karl brewer regen braking coming hardknott wrynose pass richard foster bike attempt italthough fancy giving fred whitton point mean climbing bobwallace drive youre pay save time youfor example pay stop minute mile top stop mile back charging spot turn pleasant place nice landscaping variety type food good wifi connexion richard foster guess key isnt manufacturer offer range range battery simply pay base price battery extra pootling shop back pay base price small battery journey that time year present frequently sending atmosphere rarely car city bicycle that couple short journey week car event

richard foster yeah made feel bit depressed well however taking heart global emission fall year time nonrecession year peak philip reference artificial intellegence elon scared everyone well good late proper safety measure regulation wakeup call chance wont year waynemaster write individual canadian municipal budget merican programme ross make sense assume theyll cheaper battery produced scale model model marion mead price model remain seen tesla demonstrated overpriced product target price target delivery date time ross well yes assuming model substantially cheaper model conclusion change bobwallace marion tesla bashing old yes tesla missed time target give tesla credit produced tesla late market car company released comparable car sooner fact deliver head head roadster mod remember slow ahead you company teslas supercharger company teslas gigafactory slower hoped yes ahead else yes martin yes building excellent product boot close far frank tesla found average household income
