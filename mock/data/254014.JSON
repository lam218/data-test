Electric car forecasts are a dime a dozen (actually, they cost a lot more than that, but they’re probably worth a dime a dozen). They often don’t account for the exponential growth that comes from disruptive technology. Some studies base growth on broad surveys of potential buyers… despite the fact that most people know very little (if anything) about electric cars , so can’t really answer such surveys in a useful way. They don’t yet realize the benefits of electric c","m_szDocBody":"sale forecast miss disruptive nature evs disruptive technology grow originally published obsession electric car forecast dime dozen
