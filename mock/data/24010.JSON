As noted yesterday, this two-post series is basically a presentation I gave to a class of renewable energy graduate students this week. Enjoy this second part, and chime in below if anything interesting or useful comes to mind. German Solar vs US Solar As noted yesterday, German solar and US solar have both been growing at a fast pace for several years n","m_szDocBody":"renewable energy big pic part including chart graph zachary shahan continuing yesterday renewable energy big pic post here renewable energy big pic part noted yesterday twopost sery basically presentation gave class renewable energy graduate student week enjoy part chime interesting mind german solar solar noted yesterday german solar solar growing fast pace year now price solar country dropping steadily however solar power capacity country relative manner germany time solar installed capita million people compared million people big difference german solar though price solar power lot price solar power germanywe back noting installed solar power germany price solar country dropped bit then general difference remain difference exist solar power project size lawrence berkeley national laboratory berkeley lab chart november tracking sun report show solar cheaper germany number people looked matter bit depth example cleantechnica contributor john farrell produced chart showing cost solar vary country part report matter cut price solar half cutting red tape here chart here chart split berkeley lab comment berkeley lab german installer reported average soft cost roughly lower average soft cost reported installer customer acquisition cost averaged germany roughly lower soft cost red tape acquisition cost party happening not weve nailed price difference occurring bit reflection occurring noticeable cause think simply germany mature market again time solar power installed capita market mature competition increase economy scale cost down talk creating greater market penetration policy solar and clean energy technology worked simple feedin tariff john noted year ago large majority world solar power wind power feedin tariff interesting factor worth noting negative effect subsidy mature maturing technology premier solar policy finance expert world jigar shah focused exclusive guest cleantechnica couple month ago article subsidy holding back solar deployment noted solar subsidy manipulated investor order higher return investment word claiming solar system cost investor gain tax credit jigar noted solar costeffective subsidy ideal customer utility state thus advise cut subsidy watch price solar fall worth noting people including school government building nonprofit organisation advantage solar power subsidy imperative inflate cost solar potential customer unnecessary subsidy controversial topic lot detail matter leave summary now wind subsidy wind power boat doesnt lend decentralised deployment solar cheapest option electricity place pulling subsidy threatening pull resulted big bust year wind and boom year bust year here energy information administration chart matter however wind energy developer investor day hope subsidy coming back bet theyd develop invest lot nonsubsidy year youre missing big tax credit year hopeful back year wait invest capital supportive region country meantime that dirty energy subsidy dont focus much post renewable energy nonrenewable energy that catchy isnt fact matter dirty energy source huge bias fiscally decade massive subsidy granted matter tackled length number occasion key note societal externality such billion year health cost coal alone massive subsidy fossil fuel industry that couple chart wind power resource page completely imbalanced government subsidy energy source subsidy year energy source german writer thomas gerke passed riddle presentation energy related number similar proportion answer government support conventional renewable energy germany billion euros true world opinion key point subside dirty energy subsidy finally cut all part that pollution externality adequately priced course done fossil fuel considerably expensive fossil fuel industry fighting change tooth nail far winning part merit order effect interesting topic cover renewable energy big picture merit order effect detailed matter cheque post link above here quick summary utility electricity buy competing electricity producer producer make bid offer electricity purchase produce extra electricity course coal power plant input coal natural gas power plant input natural gas cost money wind solar power producer however sun shining wind blowing free advantage that extra cost send electricity grid essentially nil mean solar wind project owner bid lower instance due tosubsidy texas plenty place worth noting solar power abundant peak power demand providing electricity peak demand typically expensive case long engraved stone however due symbiosis and merit order effect solar power chopping peak power price graph germany showing happening notably graph price electricity low middle day practically low electricity middle night typically middle day electricity high but solar grid world turn upside down couple image showing electricity production energy source unfortunately weve pointed couple occasion wholesale electricity price reduction merit order effect renewable energy arent passed consumer reduction retail price electricity hope exception norm technology market penetration economy scale good policy key component bright clean energy future making price coal natural gas accurately line true cost coal natural gas technology advancement breakthrough arent bad either good new weve new advancement breakthrough pretty day recent wind turbine energy storage area breakthrough energy storage solar wind biggest downside controllable available true and underacknowledged energy source complementary also sun shining wind blowing somewhere wellconnected large grid running electricity minimised moot image credit thomas gerke nonetheless based today cheaper energy storage huge boost topic keen big new day lot top scientist engineer aware not bit course bit cheap energy storage huge potential handful company working breakthrough energy storage technology ibm lithiumair battery wouldnt expect achieve aim wouldnt surprised led forward era energy storage era energy general additionally company bring home energy storage system mass market example panasonic stated yesterday mass market production market penetration tremendously bring technology cost down panasonic start producing mass market energy storage solution watch out potential energy storage solution simply battery electric vehicle balance energy supply demand mass market electric car growing fast futurecar sit parked use approximately time battery parked heard utility company ceos talking enthusiastically this though convincing argument idea taking off see dont silver bullet part solution and course youve solar power plugin electric vehicle start battery bit nonvehicle purpose potential huge renewable energy tremendously abundant comparing finite renewable planetary energy reserve terawattyear total recoverable reserve shown finite resource yearly potential shown renewable source perez perez start image presentation decided end time chart show solar energy potential year time potential finite energy reserve type fossil fuel nuclear power and wind energy tremendous potential yes renewable energy source annual potential represented potential finite energy reserve energy source close couple videos mentioned post
