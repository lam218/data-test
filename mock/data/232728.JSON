Many of us have begun dreaming of a future where most of the cars on the roads are autonomous cars , and of course electric cars. Beyond dreaming, many are expecting this will be a reality before we shed out human flesh and… well, I’ll leave it to you to guess what’s next. But how would that actually affect global warming ? Should we jump for green joy or weep about our inability to solve simple problems? The answer seems to be the overly enthusiastic one that invol","m_szDocBody":"autonomous electric taxis cut ghg emission tremendously zachary shahan originally published gas begun dreaming future
