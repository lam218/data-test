nickel pbr plant neodymium starting qualify product market end year give added capability participate performance tyre move weak segment nickel pbr part design strategic approach rubber continue move positive mix volume application highperforming tyre bob koort sneak one weve heard company serve auto market talk deceleration caution obviously automaker similar commentary sign mentioned ssbr strong performance performance plastic businesse deceleration trend auto sector chris pappas latin america automotive today performance plastic quarter issue latin america known havent deceleration automotive performance plastic business enter quarter forward business pretty good tyre auto bill important replacement tyre continue drive performance tyre watching closely bob dont change outlook gave balance year performance plastic bob koort great help chris pappas okay thank bob operator question line juvekar citi line open eric petrie good morning eric petrie basic plastic feedstock outlook forward stronger provided quarter million yearoveryear put take initially opinion amsty polycarbonate margin expansion offset moderation styrene chris pappas eric amsty part year time continuing perform well styrene polystyrene driven operating rate polycarbonate business coming back faster thought sitting call talked margin increase expect quarter driving result styrenic polymer north america bit weaker thought time quarter styrene same bit styrene component pretty nailed eric petrie second maintenance outage styrene quarter chris pappas maintenance outage poland germany styrene plant driven primarily dow chemical operate cracker major turnaround cracker plant period maintenance styrene plant period substantially quarter eric petrie okay expecting favourable inventory reval quarter specifically basic plastic feedstock chris pappas minimal mentioned half year feedstock expect large inventory reval company change course based feedstock expect minor effect quarter minor expect effect fourth quarter importantly guy pointed script half year company inventory reval effect entire company million month adjusted ebitda reported adjusted ebitda exinventory reval number substantially same now quarter direction quarter another worked midyear inventory reval impact company practical purpose half year dont expected significant number feedstock dramatically effect different eric petrie okay thank chris operator question line david fisher barclay line open david fisher yes good morning wondering talk couple inventory build working inventory synthetic rubber business volume nicely pretty big turnaround one build inventory increase volume easy comp two economic kind flow chris pappas well bill draw effect youre number fact number john kind comment that term volume question drove inventory part answer sold more ended quarter low inventory rubber ended low inventory sale lowering inventory quarter john kind comment build draw effect work john feenan yeah outage planned outage planned quarter escalation inventory inventory build favourable p&l rubber segment benefit call million million facility quarter utilised inventory meet demand volume chris talked point inventory low level offsetting impact roughly million million half year minimis effect inventory build draw important component understand performance standpoint addition turnaround chris alluded earlier note david fisher okay fair enough tonne polycarbonate chris talked increase half absolute margin number chris pappas increase definitely million increase versus million increase quartertoquarter absolute david fisher youre welcome operator question line vincent andrew morgan stanley line open vincent andrew you good morning outlook early outlook question sort balance sheet talked net leverage ltm basis time guess kind update balance sheet what sound bit step capex robust free cash flow again working capital item item thinking term cash flow forward john feenan yeah vince good morning john couple about alluded earlier continue cash generative business expect half year forward weve thought thinking internally specific order leverage time weve talked consistently past wed potential modest dividend pure chemical peer compete against range piece mention continue transform portfolio bolton acquisition higher growth higher margin return aspect them kind basket cash point generate vincent andrew okay thank chris you kind agree position sort cycle playing styrene sound confident sort couple year happen term adding capacity speak peer generically change industry year supply coming bode well sort cycle versus sort normal chris pappas dont change future reason one take today year announce today building styrene plant take year market time engineer put market number one good supply side equation year documented number two plan clear investing amstay investing building styrene polystyrene polycarbonate etc approval large sum money cost million million build styrene plant day small amount money assume board explain trailing history styrene polystyrene repeat itself memory long generally speaking hard people chin that area generally attractive main player chemical industry public announcement dont guy there landscape setting year good period time styrene polystyrene difficult year let clear entering nice plateau pretty good upside continued period time polycarbonate pretty similar arent player cost lot put polycarbonate plant ground tonne long process year arent planning planning decision made money engineering year polycarbonate world heading direction well vincent andrew okay make sense much operator question line roger smith bank america line open roger smith much good morning ssbr volume give split call regular versus enhanced ssbr term volume sale chris pappas ssbr sale percentage rubber range roger substantial portion hand drowning point objective continue move mix newer newer generation enhanced ssbr deliver performance required market higher higher performing tyre continue show that mentioned investing starting initial neodymium facility conversion end year performance tyre rubber upgrade nickel business low performer higher performer positioning asset converting product higher performance tyre roger smith syntel supposed add ssbr plant june announcement website volume change customer behaviour ahead plant coming online chris pappas heard plant due start july heard start plant base ssbr plant entry market earlier contract extend year major customer committed volume committed margin basic enhanced ssbr pretty comfortable position customer key customer ssbr asked higher quantity current contract volume written provide higher volume them effect point business roger smith lastly ssbr imported europe percent total european requirement chris pappas move down depend factor first relative europe asia big factor ssbr largely generally arbitrage scenario required move substantial volume asia europe mean lower asia europe okay number two ability produce product fact qualify european market player that jsr nippon zeon sumitomo example thirdly guess roger remember market ssbr performance tyre growing fastest asia tendency producer attend growth asia big arbitrage global strategy serve global customer answer question lot dont specific number number available public data
