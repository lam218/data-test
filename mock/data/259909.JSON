Mike333 Here’s the important point: It’s a classic “sustaining innovation”—a product that, according to Christensen’s definition, offers incrementally better performance at a higher price. – At a higher price than a standard car, but not at the market segment it competes in.  In that segment it’s actually a better price/performance ratio. – Secondly, it’s the only car in even the luxury segment that offers air-suspension. – Third, you get a premium stereo that’s more effective in a quieter EV.
