Ken Once again Tina is pretending that clean hydrogen is economically feasible when it is not. It is simple fact that fuel cell cars can only get economically feasible energy from dirty, fracked fossil fuel, making fuel cell cars dirtier than gasoline cars. Talking about research that may or may not make it to market in the distant future is meaningless. Fuel cell cars should not be sold until they are clean and that won’t be remotely possible before, at least, 2030.
