The trend is not unlike what has happened in the construction industry over the last several years. By Lawrence W. Kavanagh Jan 12, 2016 Historically, fuel economy regulations have been an effective mechanism for improving vehicle fuel economy and reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions associated with fuel combustion. Through model years 2004 to 2014, CO2 emissions decreased by 95 grams per mile (g/mi), or 21","m_szDocBody":"topic tailpipe life cycle emission time begin tailpipe full life cycle emission vehicle trend unlike happened construction industry year lawrence kavanagh historically fuel economy regulation effective mechanism improving vehicle fuel economy reducing greenhouse gas ghg emission fuel combustion model year emission decreased gramme mile percent fuel economy increased mpg percent improvement achieved development implementation engine technology regulation stringent however automaker additional solution reducing vehicle weight anticipation requirement steel industry accelerated introduction advanced strength steel ahss continue introduce ahss grade improved property material offer higher strength higher formability enable vehicle weight reduction importantly material advantage still steel meaning production generate comparatively fewer ghg emission alternative material percent recyclable steel grade life cycle vehicle part phase production driving endoflife disposal recycling production phase account percent total ghg emission internal combustion engine hybrid electric vehicle percent battery electric vehicle bevs fuel economy increase share alternate power train vehicle bevs increase production emission important production emission important environmental consideration because addition widespread adoption ahss automaker aluminium magnesium carbon fibre producing primary aluminium ingot north america generate time emission producing steel tonne steel tonne aluminium aluminium industry assertion aluminium smelter north america operate percent hydropower power accounting method regional grid information recognising imported aluminium ingot skew production emission higher production material generate time emission steel ","m_szGeo1":"United States","m_szSourceType":"source_news","m_szSrcUrl":"https://eponline.com/articles/2016/01/11/beyond-the-tailpipe-to-considering-life-cycle-emissions.aspx","m_Places":["North America"],"m_People":["Lawrence W.
