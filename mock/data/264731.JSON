Joe Viocoe The speed bump is really due to low gasoline prices.  Which H2 is NOT a benefit, since it currently at $14/kg Michael G And 200 mile EVs cost $90K+ right now.  That will decrease, and so will the cost of H2. Joe Viocoe Wow.. no honesty at all if you’re talking about a taxed/optioned Tesla, just to get the highest price for 200 miles. Michael G What other 200 mile EVs are currently available? Joe Viocoe First,… the Tesla is $70k…. So the fact that you know this, yet felt it was necessary to lie…. means you aren’t open to objective argument.
