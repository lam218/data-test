So What? August 15th, 2014 by Guest Contributor   By Michal Bacia It really is a really big deal. Before you know why it’s such a big deal, you have to know the big secret. Ready? OK, here it is: ENERGY IS FREE! That’s right. It is. Not only solar and wind energy, but oil and/or coal are also basically free. Image Credit: Rayson Ho. The gas and/or electric bill you pay are costs that are only related to the harnessing and using of the energy.
