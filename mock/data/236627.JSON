And No. This article originally posted at ILSR’s Energy Self-Reliant States The word “parity” is to the solar advocate as the word “abracadabra” is to the magician.  Through it, all things are possible.  But there’s really two kinds of solar parity with electricity prices, and the difference is significant. Take this article from Renewable Energy World last month.  It claims that solar installations in New Mexico are at grid parity – i.e. the cost of solar is equivalent or less than the cost of grid electricity – for schools that are buying solar el","m_szDocBody":"solar cheaper grid electricity yes originally posted ilsr energy selfreliant state word parity solar advocate word abracadabra
