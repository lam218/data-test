While robots have replaced people on many production lines, the next-generation of automotive assembly will come with the 3D printer revolution. Italian motorcycle maker CRP has gotten a jump-start on this new production trend by printing an all-electric superbike. One day, all our motorcycles and automobiles might be made the same way.
