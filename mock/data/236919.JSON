We’ll see. http://zacharyshahan.com/ Zachary Shahan There are a lot of comments to reply to here, so I’ll just put a few responses in a new thread: 1) Yes, PHEVs are not as ideal as pure EVs for most of us, but they are an important stepping stone at this point for many people not on the cutting-edge of tech and for whom a Nissan LEAF/Mitsubishi i doesn’t cut it. 2) What we need right now are EVs/PHEVs that pull people in. SUVs/CUVs, while note the most ecological choices, do that.
