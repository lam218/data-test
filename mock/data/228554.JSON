It’s mental readjustment. Sure, gasmobiles have greater range, but that range is practically useless 95% or 99% of the time. The idea that we need that extra range is often illogical. In the US, the average commute is 25 miles. If you don’t have a way to charge at work, you’d need your car to have 50 miles of range plus a bit more for any extra trips you may take on the way home (and to not end up","m_szDocBody":"mile range
