While there's some doubt about the future of cheap oil & gas in the US, solar photovoltaic energy has been steadily getting cheaper. The low price of commodities generally should also be positive for higher discretionary income. When ingenuity produces efficiency, where businesses don't have a competitive advantage, the benefit will flow either to consumers or to a business in the chain which does have a competitive advantage.
