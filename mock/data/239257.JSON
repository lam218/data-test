I feel very lucky to be on this boat, and I hope we keep sailing smoothly. All of the thanks I’ve given in the past several years  is still relevant today, and more. However, I also thought I’d put in some extra thanks for Bob this year, or Mr Bob (to throw in a little of the playfulness that he brings to so many articles).
