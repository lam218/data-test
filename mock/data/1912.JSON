I have heard that WIND TO HYDROGEN is being pursued strongly by the Germans in several projects and a smaller project at NREL in Colorado. That hydrogen can be collected and used, or put into a natural gas grid. So there are good things coming your way… our way. I am in Japan, and for various reasons, I think that utilities here are more likely to get into the hydrogen business with renewable generation of H2 than they are to fill up the grid with intermittent resources. In other words, utilities might be the ones building H2 stations for ","m_szDocBody":"rockne obannon impressive comment heard wind hydrogen pursued strongly german project smaller project nrel

mean produce hydrogen hydrogen extremely move intermittent generation storage final use asynchronous concerned efficiency lose sight hydrogen term that people north american pick choose waste country vast resource dont fit now iceland mention thermal electric now producing hydrogen mean store energy way japan vast wind tidal geothermal energy resource harnessing asynchronously remotely intermittently posed problem hydrogen free obstacle finally know enter age electricity time place dirt cheap time place extremely expensive cheap electricity produce hydrogen wasting now living japan happening lng situation though fluid pun price availability change price down expensive compared coal oil now people japan korea excited year ago hope cng widely people worried national debt imagine quickly disappear producing oil gas exporting modernise time make extremely productive economy pollute lot less excited development day excited battery well milliamp people constantly bringing point charging overlook drive mile day dont stop charge all ever time take pump gasoline long drive work mile place employment charge parking lot shift wouldnt pull charge regular use rare time drive mile single day charge minute hung about hell roadster upgraded battery pack mile charge smaller model wont future mile charge electric car close roadster people forum say drive mile dont time pull minute charge then average mile driven year average exceed average driving distance significant amount pull all milliamp put context trucker log omg pull charge argument made lot sense talking electric car mile needing plugged hour minute charge mile model argument starting ridiculous insisting holding passenger car figure limitation simply matter building smaller powerful electric car huge battery

well let fair lot hydrogen today natural gas electricity charging teslas today coal fair enough change future source hydrogen renewable electricity battery car coming renewable good wait isnt good elon musk started bulldinky feud place tesla concentrate selling car nissan leaf crew sell year move telling future tesla cold hard reality today department make that cleantechnica enjoy comparing mirai teslas car future grid future hmm japan charge centre gas station now tesla sale japan elon toyota intent riding elon musk coat tail divesting stay tuned heating year gigafactory woefully
