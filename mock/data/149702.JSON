Scientists have devised  components for these machines that are compatible with the human body, potentially making  them ideal for use in medical  devices such as bionic  limbs and other artificial body parts. The technology  is called microelectromechanical  systems (MEMS), and involves parts less than 100 microns wide, the  average diameter of a human hair.
