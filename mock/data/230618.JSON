As we all know, Tesla Model X production was delayed for years. I’ve seen strong arguments that was strategic (Model S demand was much higher than initially anticipated) more than forced, but very few people know what the actual story was. In any case, though, production has been held up in the past half a year to year due to a variety of bottlenecks.
