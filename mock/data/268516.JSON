By Michael McElfresh The spread of cost-effective batteries, such as Teslaâ€™s new Powerwall, will fundamentally change the way the electric grid operates, writes Michael McElfresh of Santa Clara University. Combined with other innovations, batteries in homes and businesses will transform how people and businesses treat electricity. Along the way, these batteries will improve the efficiency and reliability of the grid overall. Right now, most power is generated at large power plants a","m_szDocBody":"battery technology fundamentally change grid operate originally published energy post michael mcelfresh spread costeffective
