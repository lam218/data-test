Will India Become the Largest Nuclear Energy Producer in the World? By Economywatch Posted on Fri, 22 January 2010 23:51 | 4 It is a sobering thought. In 2006, according to the UN, India was the fourth largest emitter of carbon dioxide (C02, or greenhouse gas) in the world. At that time, it was emitting 1.5m metric tons, or 5.3% world emissions. Today, India is the third largest polluter after China and the US. And yet, over 400 million Indians are not even connected to the electricity grid. That is over a third of the populat","m_szDocBody":"india largest nuclear energy producer world india largest nuclear energy producer world economywatch posted fri sobering thought india fourth
