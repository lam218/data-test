We need to think in terms of tipping points. jeffhre Tipping points yes. Perhaps related to tipping points. I read somewhere (an article about the human genome project) that disruptive technology has many milestones to pass on the way to becoming successful â€“ 12 or 13 perhaps. Yet, seven of those milestones all occur while obtaining between merely 0 to 1% of the progress toward the end goal of success. Kyle Field It is progress towards where we need to go.
