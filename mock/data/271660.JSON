A financial bond “guru” is urging Elon Musk and Tesla Motors to exit the EV market, and focus instead on building batteries. Boy does this guy miss the point. EcoWatch reports that financial analyst Jeff Gundlach went onto Bloomberg radio, where he dishes out his idea that the world’s foremost maker of electric cars should get out of the car business. “I
