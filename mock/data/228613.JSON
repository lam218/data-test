What actions would need to be taken in the national and on the state levels? A new study from researchers at several top universities in the US recently set out to answer these questions — providing the first state-by-state outline of how the transition could be achieved by 2050. These 50 individual state plans are, as you can probably guess, quite aggressive — calling for big changes in both in","m_szDocBody":"statebystate plan bring renewable unveiled researcher jame ayre
