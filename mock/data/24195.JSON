government continue drive deployment energy technology critical future section describe important tax issue government encouraging wave strategic energy investment united state are production tax credit let turn production tax credit renewable electricity production tax credit ptc critical tax incentive renewable energy project wind geothermal biomass hydroelectric power technology other ill focus wind prominent investment resource important ptc linked electricity generation project kilowatthour electricity produced owner project tax credit tax credit mean owner project reduce tax bill amountcurrently cent kilowatt hour kwhat end year let example typical large wind farm dozen turbine generate megawatt electricity wind condition favourable part year wont produce power time instead wind turbine spin percent time wind farm generate kwh year earn tax credit ptc let clear million government investment tax code tax credit economically government spending government money investment project profitable true incentive helped stimulate investment made income tax expenditure possible short investment helped directly create economic activity growth creation government invested billion dollar wind power ptc smart investment ptc intended incentivize deployment energy source expensive fossilfuel source cost technology deployed driving technology cost curve cost wind power declined percent declining cost critical clean energy built improve environment diversify power mix indeed ptc led massive amount growth wind industry gigawatt capacity online growth attributable ptc see creation ptc extended year time effect virtually investment effect investment tremendous formal economic study suggesting positive outcome ptc economist gilbert metcalf example find the data suggest current investment wind explained production tax credit wind for information ptc work cap report americas hidden power bill ptc real benefit american worker people work wind industry worker spread country industry people making turbine installing them operating them goodpaying job unfortunately dont people working wind industry could windmanufacturing sector grown recent year historically crippled ptc expiring year manufacturer onagain offagain cycle industry leave virtually business year american wind farm imported part indeed demand turbine part domestic manufacturing capacity particular manufacturing capacity insufficient gearboxe generator bearing casting lack consistent policy contributing underinvestment domestic production strategic technology economic competitor simultaneously developed robust manufacturing capacity serve growing domestic demand meet global demand technology export see past year however united state experienced tremendous growth wind manufacturing partly stable ptc recently extended year part american recovery reinvestment act stimulus time manufacturer set shop country composition domestic part turbine made steadily increased wind energy import declined lesson congress longterm ptc valuable shortterm extension impact job growth allowing ptc expire year extended year give confidence stability investor supply chain doesnt mean however ptc extended indefinitely review biggest problem deeply flawed fossilfuel subsidy congress extend timeframe build review process evaluate credit adjusted way congress review size credit

production tax credit primarily benefit wind solar industry primary beneficiary investment tax credit itc itc work differently make economic sense type capital investment required developing solar energy project tax credit spread year awarded energy produced renewable energy developer upfront tax credit based initial investment project solar power credit worth percent initial investment building owner spend million put megawatt solar energy system building rooftop building owner awarded million tax creditbut owner allowed tax credit life project upfront onetime nature itc real benefit solar power first solar expensive technology initially instal investor special investmentbased incentive second solar younger industry wind technology isnt proven long term mean future energy production slightly solar power wind power productionbased incentive valuable ptc itc tremendous success solar industry experienced extremely impressive cost improvement see surprisingly cost fall demand rise solar industry employ people year ago itc extended part stimulus bill extension provided valuable certainty solar market expire congress review size effectiveness credit treasury cash grant lieu tax credit incredible successe ptc itc arent perfect dont provide complete offering meet full range projectfinancing faced emerging renewable energy market biggest problem renewable energy project structured dont earn profit year project life developer owe taxe profit not revenue owe taxe year building project time tax credit reduce amount taxe owed thus developer doesnt owe taxe credit worthless structural limitation tax code support strategically valuable public investment traditionally project developer worked problem bringing socalled tax equity investor investorstypically large financial institution essentially buy tax credit project cash tax equity investor extremely valuable developer monetize tax benefit owing taxe system worked fairly financial crisis billion tax equity pool tax equity capital shrank dramatically though large financial institution longer owed taxe lost money shortfall fixed called treasury cash grant programme programme section programme included stimulus bill thing make ptceligible technology eligible itc developer cash grant itc mean renewable developer cash grant treasury department percent initial investment project solved tax equity market shortfall problem allowed renewable investment continue shrinking wind solar industry grew recent recession largely section programme helped financing unfortunately programme drew close end creating programme congress extended year end extend programme year ideally change run concurrently underlying ptc itc matching expiration date important expected tax equity meet demand partnership renewable energy finance estimated total billion tax equity treasury cash grant project billion tax equity recent history suggest needed see cash grant programme make ptc itc effective efficient

clean energy americas ocean megawatt offshore wind energy capacity permitted globe united state account barely percent that generate watt electricity abundant carbonfree source power shortage interest building offshore wind farm project moving forward permitting siting government investment provide critical support leveraging private capital investment project accelerate growth american industry way offshore wind solar onshore wind instance technology extremely upfront cost expected rapidly decline time significant barrier investor entering market further offshore wind technology largely unknown unproven eye american investor return discounted capital market future production offshore wind farm onshore wind production tax credit unpredictable congress address making offshore wind temporarily eligible itc suit emerging industry industry grow closely resemble onshore wind technology shift back ptc conclusion clean renewable energy bright spot economy industry success storey resulted job creation scientific innovation cleaner air stronger manufacturing sector young industry significant public investment importantly investment structured support entire industry efficient costeffective manner government invest clean energy match tool specific technology businesse theyre supporting explained production tax credit extended fundamental tool government invest renewable
