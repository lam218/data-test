proposed added grid year development central station solar project encouraged include assessment process proposed project completed notwithstanding clear integrate renewable resource longer question priority accomplishing goal fundamentally change bulk power system plan operate think change industry approached cautiously collectively industry own operate asset north america running change made system result blackout good one but submit today change supply demand significantly outpaced transmission development past year leaving grid operating closer edge past increased reliance natural gas raised significant concern availability deliverability critical fuel future diversified electricity supply portfolio base load nuclear coal needed nuclear plant require substantial time built approved advanced coal technology time mature cyber security growing threat innovation refuelling transportation sector plugin hybrid electric vehicle phev rely electric grid supply energy need latest estimate
