Wind turbines in Kemi Finland “The main message is the option of a fully renewable energy system must be seen as a valid option for the future, rather than a radical alternative,” said Christian Breyer, Lappeenranta University of Technology’s (LUT) Professor for Solar Economy. “Finland certainly has an abundance of ren","m_szDocBody":"fully renewable energy system economical viable finland
