There has been a dramatic increase in greenhouse gases, particularly carbon dioxide (CO2), in recent times. According to the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), CO2 levels in the atmosphere now stand at 387 parts per million (ppm), up almost 40% since the industrial revolution.
