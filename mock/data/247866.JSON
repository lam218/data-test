note lot people mix grid world greener day electricity charge model greener greener today efficient greener like average energy payback model mile that net benefit compared gasolinepowered car contrary concerned competition major car brand tesla hoping stimulate competition bring major car company world faster potential bigger battery pack model future maybe year main focus price kwh production next cheaper car elon note goal tesla create compelling massmarket electric car emphasised money made model model put directly making massmarket affordable compelling electric car affordable electric car great car drive forward electric car revolution proprietary number elon wasnt give exact number cost kwh model battery pack now note goal drop number affordable massmarket electric tesla ideally however critical cost drop elon creating capacity produce battery car discussed gigafactory tesla planning build aim gwh production year note battery production kind globally korea china japan etc working software upgrade uphill start higher model top speed tesla working elon think tesla bring autonomous car marketan autopilot car tesla call highest priority identify sensor suite installed time overall though longterm priority tesla elon think bring autopilot car market questioner noted that knowing electric car beforehand daughter sold buying model minute noted world bmw based that asked tesla vision largest car manufacturer world elon goal market share sake world transform electric car elon noted approximately million car manufactured year billion car operating world car evs year fully transition evs bad consequence elon noted perspective worth noting according elon tesla isnt decimal point percentage automobile market share market share sell car year nearterm objective boy asked tesla making electric boat plane addition car elon naturally noted focused building car moment plane idea head and named specific model questioner asked dimension model elon noted marry aesthetic functionality suv hard challenge estimate design problem time harder end tesla aiming wheel base same length similar just longer width same didnt high height shouldnt problem normal garage note falcon wing door make production overall elon discussed hated car industry car company show greatlooking show car dont bring market drive crazy tesla noted completely opposite rule car prototype shown customer production car better model energy consumption greater model tesla electric motor awd order make improvement efficiencyneutral improvement cto straubel note pretty big breakthrough awd think time hasnt efficiency tradeoff awd version car tesla mirror long term matter long take regulatory approval cameras rearview mirror safer questioner calling elon innovative businessman world asked inspiration family friend colleague elon noted reading biography history noted great benefit reading working industry such space industry straubel noted end goal supercharger network road network growing growing elon noted supercharger introduced put theyve upgraded station year elon noted working improving seat comfort model portion improvement place week hes option retrofit seat seat open course pay however noted complex complicated sensor seat determine passenger baby child adult sitting order adequately deploy air bag accident commenter elon noted life expectancy model greater normal gasoline car with replacement battery pack year typical year typical gasoline car elon noted tesla make power train battery pack motor toyota rav electric mercede coming month however overall note car company poor motivation produce lowest number electric vehicle required law note drive advancement mainstream car company government regulation competitive pressure note government regulation weak regard and car company lot lobbying power way teslas conclusion electric competitor pressure model arrive norway summer quarter awd version model time elon

plan helping natural gas bbox ummm yeah cuz significant portion electricity north america originate natural gas yeah elon bigger plan selling car promise free energy life ignoring energy from today combination burning natural gas coal nuclear thrown good measure but youre elon bigger fish fry opposed ensuring longterm viability product bobwallace upset antiearth fantasy elon solar company installing solar cover car use bbox wow personal real quick that talking today right someday solar player yet cover car wow math this youre assuming tesla remain bit player right gwennedd solar player country world wind matter btw today important stir argument tesla major player field car manufacturer making token effort produce evs car show produced buyer putting order them snooze lose wake fact late bbox solar player suggested otherwise point evs common day significant preponderance population wont solar wind combined fuel demand created vehicle math expect balance from today foreseeable

late night charging sort dont good handle electricity drive mile kwh average mile year solar panel average america bobwallace guess elon bigger plan selling car promise free energy life ignoring energy year solar panel installed now dont tesla major car manufacturer not elon company installing lot solar aware panel take provide electricity needed charge bbox throw panel rooftop run tesla mile home youre let talk hundred supercharger mile country let pretend tesla factor supercharger station busy gas station today let battery pull station wanting topped depleted and round number let guy topped minute deliver watt minute let pretend square foot solar cell produce watt daylight hour very conservative here day but busy highway youve gotta recharge teslas right supercharger harvest hour sunshine exposure period energy immediately consumed real time people filling charge battery recharge people supercharger night right square feet solar panel run super charger wait supercharger dont gas station pump math kid number possibly work out mind grant land right place thousand solar panel mile major highway answer solar factor long run elon tesla reliant coal lng nuclear source energy require assuming sunshine hour day day year conversion storage losse process real answer wont hour day day year storage conversion losse significant kick percent number panel make difference bobwallace panel highway hear electricity grid bobwallace run number kwh kwh make kwh account charging loss assume constant flow car kwh kwh put panel middle lower average solar hour day panel watt
