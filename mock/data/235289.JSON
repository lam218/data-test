Haters gonna hate, but Tesla* just busted through the 50,000/year sales barrier, as it projected it would; Model X production is ramping up exponentially; and the company is now bringing in well over $1 billion a quarter (maybe $2 billion a quarter) in revenue. Tesla (TSLA) stock took a hit yesterday, apparently because Tesla deliveries were on the lower end of its guidance, but everything seems to be moving along as planned at Tesla Motors.
