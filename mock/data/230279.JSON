October 29th, 2012 by Joshua S Hill     A new study released last week has looked at the implications of switching the focus of mitigating climate change from developing energy supply technologies towards developing energy efficient cars, buildings, and domestic appliances. The study, published in the journal Nature Climate Change shows that twice as much effort is currently being directed towards developing supply technologies such as new power stations than is being directed towards improving the efficiency of end-use technologies. “Abou","m_szDocBody":"focus energy efficiency energy supply joshua hill study released week looked implication switching focus
